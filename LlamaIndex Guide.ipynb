When applied to a function defined on a one-dimensional domain, it denotes the standard derivative of the function as defined in calculus. When applied to a field (a function defined on a multi-dimensional domain), it may denote any one of three operations depending on the way it is applied: the gradient or (locally) steepest slope of a scalar field (or sometimes of a vector field, as in the Navier–Stokes equations); the divergence of a vector field; or the curl (rotation) of a vector field.\\nDel is a very convenient mathematical notation for those three operations (gradient, divergence, and curl) that makes many equations easier to write and remember.  The del symbol (or nabla) can be formally defined as a three-dimensional vector operator whose three components are the corresponding partial derivative operators. As a vector operator, it can act on scalar and vector fields in three different ways, giving rise to three different differential operations: first, it can act on scalar fields by a \"formal\" scalar multiplication—to give a vector field called the gradient; second, it can act on vector fields by a \"formal\" dot product—to give a scalar field called the divergence; and lastly, it can act on vector fields by a \"formal\" cross product—to give a vector field called the curl. These \"formal\" products do not necessarily commute with other operators or products.  These three uses, detailed below, are summarized as:\\n\\nGradient: \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        grad\\n        \\u2061\\n        f\\n        =\\n        ∇\\n        f\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\operatorname {grad} f=\\\\nabla f}\\n  \\nDivergence: \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        div\\n        \\u2061\\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              v\\n              →\\n            \\n          \\n        \\n        =\\n        ∇\\n        ⋅\\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              v\\n              →\\n            \\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\operatorname {div} {\\\\vec {v}}=\\\\nabla \\\\cdot {\\\\vec {v}}}\\n  \\nCurl: \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        curl\\n        \\u2061\\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              v\\n              →\\n            \\n          \\n        \\n        =\\n        ∇\\n        ×\\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              v\\n              →\\n            \\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\operatorname {curl} {\\\\vec {v}}=\\\\nabla \\\\times {\\\\vec {v}}}\\n  \\n\\n\\n== Definition ==\\nIn the Cartesian coordinate system \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          \\n            R\\n          \\n          \\n            n\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\mathbb {R} ^{n}}\\n   with coordinates \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        (\\n        \\n          x\\n          \\n            1\\n          \\n        \\n        ,\\n        …\\n        ,\\n        \\n          x\\n          \\n            n\\n          \\n        \\n        )\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle (x_{1},\\\\dots ,x_{n})}\\n   and standard basis \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        {\\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              \\n                e\\n                →\\n              \\n            \\n          \\n          \\n            1\\n          \\n        \\n        ,\\n        …\\n        ,\\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              \\n                e\\n                →\\n              \\n            \\n          \\n          \\n            n\\n          \\n        \\n        }\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\{{\\\\vec {e}}_{1},\\\\dots ,{\\\\vec {e}}_{n}\\\\}}\\n  , del is a vector operator whose \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          x\\n          \\n            1\\n          \\n        \\n        ,\\n        …\\n        ,\\n        \\n          x\\n          \\n            n\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle x_{1},\\\\dots ,x_{n}}\\n   components are the partial derivative operators \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          \\n            ∂\\n            \\n              ∂\\n              \\n                x\\n                \\n                  1\\n                \\n              \\n            \\n          \\n        \\n        ,\\n        …\\n        ,\\n        \\n          \\n            ∂\\n            \\n              ∂\\n              \\n                x\\n                \\n                  n\\n                \\n              \\n            \\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\partial  \\\\over \\\\partial x_{1}},\\\\dots ,{\\\\partial  \\\\over \\\\partial x_{n}}}\\n  ; that is,\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        ∇\\n        =\\n        \\n          ∑\\n          \\n            i\\n            =\\n            1\\n          \\n          \\n            n\\n          \\n        \\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              \\n                e\\n                →\\n              \\n            \\n          \\n          \\n            i\\n          \\n        \\n        \\n          \\n            ∂\\n            \\n              ∂\\n              \\n                x\\n                \\n                  i\\n                \\n              \\n            \\n          \\n        \\n        =\\n        \\n          (\\n          \\n            \\n              \\n                ∂\\n                \\n                  ∂\\n                  \\n                    x\\n                    \\n                      1\\n                    \\n                  \\n                \\n              \\n            \\n            ,\\n            …\\n            ,\\n            \\n              \\n                ∂\\n                \\n                  ∂\\n                  \\n                    x\\n                    \\n                      n\\n                    \\n                  \\n                \\n              \\n            \\n          \\n          )\\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\nabla =\\\\sum _{i=1}^{n}{\\\\vec {e}}_{i}{\\\\partial  \\\\over \\\\partial x_{i}}=\\\\left({\\\\partial  \\\\over \\\\partial x_{1}},\\\\ldots ,{\\\\partial  \\\\over \\\\partial x_{n}}\\\\right)}\\n  Where the expression in parentheses is a row vector.

Because of the diversity of vector products (scalar, dot, cross) one application of del already gives rise to three major derivatives: the gradient (scalar product), divergence (dot product), and curl (cross product). Applying these three sorts of derivatives again to each other gives five possible second derivatives, for a scalar field f or a vector field v; the use of the scalar Laplacian and vector Laplacian gives two more:\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              \\n                div\\n                \\u2061\\n                (\\n                grad\\n

Whereas a vector is an object with both a magnitude and direction, del has neither a magnitude nor a direction until it operates on a function.\\nFor that reason, identities involving del must be derived with care, using both vector identities and differentiation identities such as the product rule.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nDel in cylindrical and spherical coordinates\\nNotation for differentiation\\nVector calculus identities\\nMaxwell\\'s equations\\nNavier–Stokes equations\\nTable of mathematical symbols\\nQuabla operator\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\nWillard Gibbs & Edwin Bidwell Wilson (1901) Vector Analysis, Yale University Press, 1960: Dover Publications.\\nSchey, H.

Tokyo serves as Japan\\'s economic center and the seat of both the Japanese government and the Emperor of Japan.\\nPrior to the 17th century, Tokyo was predominantly a fishing village and was named Edo. In 1603, however, the city ascended to political prominence after being named the seat of the Tokugawa shogunate. By the mid-18th century, Edo emerged as one of the world\\'s most-populous cities with a population of over one million people. Following the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the imperial capital in Kyoto was moved to Edo, and the city was renamed Tokyo (lit.\\u2009\\'Eastern Capital\\'). In 1923, Tokyo was damaged substantially by the Great Kanttō earthquake and was later decimated by allied bombing raids during World War II in retailiation for Japan\\'s attack on Pearl Harbor. \\nSince 1943, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government has administered the prefecture\\'s special wards, including Tokyo City), various commuter towns and suburbs in its western area, and two outlying island chains known as the Tokyo Islands.\\nBeginning in the mid-20th century, Tokyo underwent rapid reconstruction and expansion that contributed to the era\\'s so-called Japanese economic miracle in which Japan\\'s economy propelled to the second-largest in the world behind the United States.Tokyo, which is categorized as an Alpha+ city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network, is Japan\\'s leading business hub and part of an industrial region that includes Yokohama, Kawasaki, and Chiba. As of 2023, the city is home to 29 of the world\\'s largest 500 companies listed in the annual Fortune Global 500.In 2020, Tokyo ranked fourth on the Global Financial Centres Index behind New York City, London, and Shanghai. The city is home to the world\\'s tallest tower, Tokyo Skytree, and the world\\'s largest underground floodwater diversion facility, the Metropolitan Area Outer Underground Discharge Channel in Kasukabe, Saitama, a Tokyo suburb. The Tokyo Metro Ginza Line, which opened in 1927, is the oldest underground metro line in East Asia. Tokyo is recognized as one of the world\\'s most livable cities; it was ranked fourth in the world in Global Livability Ranking, published in 2021.In the 20th and 21st centuries, Tokyo has hosted several major international events, including the 1964 Summer Olympics and 1964 Summer Paralympics, the 2020 Summer Olympics, and three G7 summits in 1979, 1986, and 1993. Tokyo is an international research and development hub and an academic center with several major universities, including the University of Tokyo. Tokyo Station is the central hub for the Shinkansen, Japan\\'s high-speed railway network, and Shinjuku Station in Tokyo is the world\\'s busiest train station. Notable special wards in Tokyo include Chiyoda, the site of the National Diet Building and the Tokyo Imperial Palace, Shinjuku, the city\\'s administrative center, and Shibuya, a commercial, cultural, and business hub in the city.\\n\\n\\n== Etymology ==\\n Tokyo was originally known as Edo (江戸), a kanji compound of 江 (e, \"cove, inlet\") and 戸 (to, \"entrance, gate, door\"). The name, which can be translated as \"estuary\", is a reference to the original settlement\\'s location at the meeting of the Sumida River and Tokyo Bay. During the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the name of the city was changed to Tokyo (東京, from 東 tō \"east\", and 京 kyō \"capital\"), when it became the new imperial capital, in line with the East Asian tradition of including the word capital (京) in the name of the capital city (for example, Kyoto (京都), Keijō (京城), Beijing (北京), Nanjing (南京), and Xijing (西京)). During the early Meiji period, the city was sometimes called \"Tōkei\", an alternative pronunciation for the same characters representing \"Tokyo\", making it a kanji homograph. Some surviving official English documents use the spelling \"Tokei\"; however, this pronunciation is now obsolete.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Pre-1869 (Edo period) ===\\n\\nTokyo was originally a village called Edo, in what was formerly part of the old Musashi Province. Edo was first fortified by the Edo clan, in the late twelfth century. In 1457, Ōta Dōkan built Edo Castle. In 1590, Tokugawa Ieyasu moved from Mikawa Province (his lifelong base) to the Kantō region. When he became shōgun in 1603, Edo became the center of his ruling. During the subsequent Edo period, Edo grew into one of the largest cities in the world with a population topping one million by the 18th century.Edo was still the home of the Tokugawa shogunate and not the capital of Japan (the Emperor himself lived in Kyoto almost continuously from 794 to 1868). During the Edo era, the city enjoyed a prolonged period of peace known as the Pax Tokugawa, and in the presence of such peace, the shogunate adopted a stringent policy of seclusion, which helped to perpetuate the lack of any serious military threat to the city. The absence of war-inflicted devastation allowed Edo to devote the majority of its resources to rebuilding in the wake of the consistent fires, earthquakes, and other devastating natural disasters that plagued the city.\\nThis prolonged period of seclusion however came to an end with the arrival of American Commodore Matthew C. Perry in 1853. Commodore Perry forced the opening of the ports of Shimoda and Hakodate, leading to an increase in the demand for new foreign goods and subsequently a severe rise in inflation. Social unrest mounted in the wake of these higher prices and culminated in widespread rebellions and demonstrations, especially in the form of the \"smashing\" of rice establishments. Meanwhile, supporters of the Emperor leveraged the disruption that these widespread rebellious demonstrations were causing to further consolidate power by overthrowing the last Tokugawa shōgun, Yoshinobu, in 1867. After 265 years, the Pax Tokugawa came to an end.\\n\\nGallery\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n=== 1869–1943 ===\\n\\nEdo was renamed Tokyo (Eastern Capital) on September 3, 1868, as the new government was consolidating its power after the fall of the Edo shogunate. The young Emperor Meiji visited once at the end of that year and eventually moved in in 1869. Tokyo was already the nation\\'s political center, and the emperor\\'s residence made it a de facto imperial capital as well, with the former Edo Castle becoming the Imperial Palace. The city of Tokyo was officially established on May 1, 1889.\\nThe Tokyo Metro Ginza Line portion between Ueno and Asakusa was the first subway line built in Japan and East Asia completed on December 30, 1927. Central Tokyo, like Osaka, has been designed since about 1900 to be centered on major railway stations in a high-density fashion, so suburban railways were built relatively cheaply at street level and with their own right-of-way. Though expressways have been built in Tokyo, the basic design has not changed.Tokyo went on to suffer two major catastrophes in the 20th century: the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake, which left 140,000 dead or missing; and World War II.\\nGallery\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n=== 1943–1945 ===\\n\\nIn 1943, the city of Tokyo merged with the prefecture of Tokyo to form the \"Metropolitan Prefecture\" of Tokyo. Since then, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government served as both the prefecture government for Tokyo, as well as administering the special wards of Tokyo, for what had previously been Tokyo City. World War II wreaked widespread destruction of most of the city due to the persistent Allied air raids on Japan and the use of incendiary bombs. The bombing of Tokyo in 1944 and 1945 is estimated to have killed between 75,000 and 200,000 civilians and left more than half of the city destroyed.The deadliest night of the war came on March 9-10, 1945, the night of the American \"Operation Meetinghouse\" raid; as nearly 700,000 incendiary bombs rained on the eastern half of the city, mainly in heavily residential wards. Two-fifths of the city were completely burned, more than 276,000 buildings were demolished, 100,000 civilians were killed, and 110,000 more were injured. Between 1940 and 1945, the population of Japan\\'s capital city dwindled from 6,700,000 to less than 2,800,000, with the majority of those who lost their homes living in \"ramshackle, makeshift huts\".\\nGallery\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n=== 1945–present ===\\nAfter the war, Tokyo became the base from which the United States under Douglas MacArthur administered Japan for six years. Tokyo struggled to rebuild as occupation authorities stepped in and drastically cut back on Japanese government rebuilding programs, focusing instead on simply improving roads and transportation. Tokyo did not experience fast economic growth until the 1950s.After the occupation of Japan ended in 1952, Tokyo was completely rebuilt and was showcased to the world during the 1964 Summer Olympics, such as the Yoyogi National Gymnasium and the 0 Series Shinkansen, the first bullet train of its class in the world.  The 1970s and the 1980s brought new high-rise developments. In 1978, Sunshine 60 – the tallest skyscraper in Asia until 1985, and in Japan until 1991 – and Narita International Airport were constructed, and the population increased to about 11 million in the metropolitan area. The Edo-Tokyo Open Air Architectural Museum has historic Japanese buildings that existed in the urban landscape of pre-war Tokyo.\\nTokyo\\'s subway and commuter rail network became one of the busiest in the world as more and more people moved to the area. In the 1980s, real estate prices skyrocketed during a real estate and debt bubble. The bubble burst in the early 1990s, and many companies, banks, and individuals were caught with mortgage-backed debts while real estate was shrinking in value. A major recession followed, making the 1990s Japan\\'s \"Lost Decade\", from which it is now slowly recovering.\\nTokyo still sees new urban developments on large lots of less profitable land. Recent projects include Ebisu Garden Place, Tennōzu Isle, Shiodome, Roppongi Hills, Shinagawa (Shinagawa Station, a major hub for Shinkansen), and the Marunouchi side of Tokyo Station. Buildings of significance have been demolished for more up-to-date shopping facilities such as Omotesando Hills.Land reclamation projects in Tokyo have also been going on for centuries. The most prominent is the Odaiba area, now a major shopping and entertainment center. Various plans have been proposed for transferring national government functions from Tokyo to secondary capitals in other regions of Japan, to slow down rapid development in Tokyo and revitalize economically lagging areas of the country. These plans have been controversial within Japan and have yet to be realized.\\nThe 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami that devastated much of the northeastern coast of Honshu was felt in Tokyo. However, due to Tokyo\\'s earthquake-resistant infrastructure, damage in Tokyo was very minor compared to areas directly hit by the tsunami, although activity in the city was largely halted. The subsequent nuclear crisis caused by the tsunami has also largely left Tokyo unaffected, despite occasional spikes in radiation levels.On September 7, 2013, the IOC selected Tokyo to host the 2020 Summer Olympics. Tokyo thus became the first Asian city to host the Olympic Games twice. However, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 Olympic Games took place from July 23, 2021, to August 8, 2021. It is also unclear how the city will deal with an increasing number of issues, urging scholars to offer possible alternatives approaches to tackle the most urgent problems. Although, the COVID-19 pandemic in Tokyo has impeded the growth of many industries, the real estate market in Japan is yet to be negatively impacted. Japanese real estate has become one of the safest investments for foreign investors around the world.\\nGallery\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n== Geography and government ==\\n\\nThe mainland portion of Tokyo lies northwest of Tokyo Bay and measures about 90 km (56 mi) east to west and 25 km (16 mi) north to south. The average elevation in Tokyo is 40 m (131 ft). Chiba Prefecture borders it to the east, Yamanashi to the west, Kanagawa to the south, and Saitama to the north. Mainland Tokyo is further subdivided into the special wards (occupying the eastern half) and the Tama area (多摩地域) stretching westwards. Tokyo has a latitude of 35.65 (near the 36th parallel north), which makes it more southern than Rome (41.90), Madrid (40.41), New York City (40.71) and Beijing (39.91).Within the administrative boundaries of Tokyo Metropolis are two island chains in the Pacific Ocean directly south: the Izu Islands, and the Ogasawara Islands, which stretch more than 1,000 km (620 mi) away from the mainland. Because of these islands and the mountainous regions to the west, Tokyo\\'s overall population density figures far under-represent the real figures for the urban and suburban regions of Tokyo.Under Japanese law, the prefecture of Tokyo is designated as a to (都), translated as metropolis. Tokyo Prefecture is the most populous prefecture and the densest, with 6,100 inhabitants per square kilometer (16,000/sq mi); by geographic area it is the third-smallest, above only Osaka and Kagawa. Its administrative structure is similar to that of Japan\\'s other prefectures. The 23 special wards (特別区, tokubetsu-ku), which until 1943 constituted the city of Tokyo, are self-governing municipalities, each having a mayor, a council, and the status of a city.\\nIn addition to these 23 special wards, Tokyo also includes 26 more cities (市 -shi), five towns (町 -chō or machi), and eight villages (村 -son or -mura), each of which has a local government. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government administers the whole metropolis including the 23 special wards and the cities and towns that constitute the prefecture. It is headed by a publicly elected governor and metropolitan assembly. Its headquarters is in Shinjuku Ward.\\n\\n\\n=== Municipalities ===\\n\\nSince 2001, Tokyo consists of 62 municipalities: 23 special wards, 26 cities, 5 towns and 8 villages. Any municipality of Japan has a directly elected mayor and a directly elected assembly, each elected on independent four-year cycles. 23 of Tokyo\\'s municipalities cover the area that had been Tokyo City until WWII, 30 remain today in the Tama area (former North Tama, West Tama and South Tama districts), 9 on Tokyo\\'s outlying islands.\\n\\nThe special wards (特別区, tokubetsu-ku) of Tokyo comprise the area formerly incorporated as Tokyo City. The special wards use the word \"city\" in their official English name (e.g. Chiyoda City). The wards differ from other cities in having a unique administrative relationship with the prefectural government. Certain municipal functions, such as waterworks, sewerage, and fire-fighting, are handled by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. To pay for the added administrative costs, the prefecture collects municipal taxes, which would usually be levied by the city. The \"three central wards\" of Tokyo – Chiyoda, Chūō and Minato – are the business core of the city, with a daytime population more than seven times higher than their nighttime population. Chiyoda Ward is unique in that it is in the very heart of the former Tokyo City, yet is one of the least populated wards. It is occupied by many major Japanese companies and is also the seat of the national government, and the Japanese emperor. It is often called the \"political center\" of the country. Akihabara, known for being an otaku cultural center and a shopping district for computer goods, is also in Chiyoda.\\nTo the west of the special wards, Tokyo Metropolis consists of cities, towns, and villages that enjoy the same legal status as those elsewhere in Japan. While serving as \"bed towns\" for those working in central Tokyo, some of them also have a local commercial and industrial base, such as Tachikawa. Collectively, these are often known as the Tama area or Western Tokyo. The far west of the Tama area is occupied by the district (gun) of Nishi-Tama. Much of this area is mountainous and unsuitable for urbanization. The highest mountain in Tokyo, Mount Kumotori, is 2,017 m (6,617 ft) high; other mountains in Tokyo include Takanosu (1,737 m (5,699 ft)), Odake (1,266 m (4,154 ft)), and Mitake (929 m (3,048 ft)). Lake Okutama, on the Tama River near Yamanashi Prefecture, is Tokyo\\'s largest lake. The district is composed of three towns (Hinode, Mizuho and Okutama) and one village (Hinohara). The Tokyo Metropolitan Government has designated Hachiōji, Tachikawa, Machida, Ōme and Tama New Town as regional centers of the Tama area, as part of its plans to relocate urban functions away from central Tokyo.\\nTokyo has numerous outlying islands, which extend as far as 1,850 km (1,150 mi) from central Tokyo. Because of the islands\\' distance from the administrative headquarters of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government in Shinjuku, local subprefectural branch offices administer them. The Izu Islands are a group of volcanic islands and form part of the Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park. The islands in order from closest to Tokyo are Izu Ōshima, Toshima, Nii-jima, Shikine-jima, Kōzu-shima, Miyake-jima, Mikurajima, Hachijō-jima, and Aogashima. The Izu Islands are grouped into three subprefectures. Izu Ōshima and Hachijojima are towns. The remaining islands are six villages, with Niijima and Shikinejima forming one village. The Ogasawara Islands include, from north to south, Chichi-jima, Nishinoshima, Haha-jima, Kita Iwo Jima, Iwo Jima, and Minami Iwo Jima. Ogasawara also administers two tiny outlying islands: Minami Torishima, the easternmost point in Japan and at 1,850 km (1,150 mi) the most distant island from central Tokyo, and Okinotorishima, the southernmost point in Japan. Japan\\'s claim on an exclusive economic zone (EEZ) surrounding Okinotorishima is contested by China and South Korea as they regard Okinotorishima as uninhabitable rocks which have no EEZ. The Iwo chain and the outlying islands have no permanent population, but hosts Japan Self-Defense Forces personnel. Local populations are only found on Chichi-Jima and Haha-Jima. The islands form both Ogasawara Subprefecture and the village of Ogasawara, Tokyo.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n==== Municipal mergers ====\\n\\nWhen Tokyo reached its current extent except for smaller border changes in 1893, it consisted of over 170 municipalities, 1 (by definition: district-independent) city, nine districts with their towns and villages, plus the island communities that had never part of ritsuryō districts. By 1953, the number of municipalities had dropped to 97. The current total of 62 was reached in 2001.\\n\\n\\n=== National parks ===\\nAs of March 31, 2008, 36% of the total land area of the prefecture was designated as Natural Parks (second only to Shiga Prefecture), namely the Chichibu Tama Kai, Fuji-Hakone-Izu, and Ogasawara National Parks (the last a UNESCO World Heritage Site); Meiji no Mori Takao Quasi-National Park; and Akikawa Kyūryō, Hamura Kusabana Kyūryō, Sayama, Takao Jinba, Takiyama, and Tama Kyūryō Prefectural Natural Parks.A number of museums are located in Ueno Park: Tokyo National Museum, National Museum of Nature and Science, Shitamachi Museum and National Museum for Western Art, among others. There are also artworks and statues at several places in the park. There is also a zoo in the park, and the park is a popular destination to view cherry blossoms.\\n\\n\\n=== Earthquakes ===\\n\\n\\n==== Minor quakes ====\\nTokyo is near the boundary of three plates, making it an extremely active region for smaller quakes and slippage which frequently affect the urban area with swaying as if in a boat, although epicenters within mainland Tokyo (excluding Tokyo\\'s 2,000 km (1,243 mi)–long island jurisdiction) are quite rare. It is not uncommon in the metro area to have hundreds of these minor quakes (magnitudes 4–6) that can be felt in a single year, something local residents merely brush off but can be a source of anxiety not only for foreign visitors but for Japanese from elsewhere as well. They rarely cause much damage (sometimes a few injuries) as they are either too small or far away as quakes tend to dance around the region. Particularly active are offshore regions and to a lesser extent Chiba and Ibaraki.\\n\\n\\n==== Infrequent powerful quakes ====\\nTokyo has been hit by powerful megathrust earthquakes in 1703, 1782, 1812, 1855, 1923, and much more indirectly (with some liquefaction in landfill zones) in 2011; the frequency of direct and large quakes is a relative rarity. The 1923 earthquake, with an estimated magnitude of 8.3, killed 142,000 people, the last time the urban area was directly hit.\\n\\n\\n=== Volcanic eruptions ===\\nMount Fuji is about 100 km (62 mi) southwest of Tokyo. There is a low risk of eruption. The last recorded was the Hōei eruption which started on December 16, 1707, and ended about January 1, 1708 (16 days). During the Hōei eruption, the ash amount was 4 cm in southern Tokyo (bay area) and 2 cm to 0.5 cm in central Tokyo. Kanagawa had 16 cm to 8 cm ash and Saitama 0.5 to 0 cm. If the wind blows north-east it could send volcanic ash to Tokyo metropolis. According to the government, less than a millimeter of the volcanic ash from a Mount Fuji eruption could cause power grid problems such as blackouts and stop trains in the Tokyo metropolitan area. A mixture of ash with rain could stick to cellphone antennas, power lines and cause temporary power outages. The affected areas would need to be evacuated.\\n\\n\\n=== Water management ===\\nTokyo is located on the Kantō Plain with five river systems and dozens of rivers that expand during each season. Important rivers are Edogawa, Nakagawa, Arakawa, Kandagawa, Megurogawa and Tamagawa. In 1947, Typhoon Kathleen struck Tokyo, destroying 31,000 homes and killing 1,100 people. In 1958, Typhoon Ida dropped 400 mm (16 in) of rain in a single week, causing streets to flood. In the 1950s and 1960s, the government invested 6–7% of the national budget on disaster and risk reduction. A huge system of dams, levees and tunnels was constructed. The purpose is to manage heavy rain, typhonic rain, and river floods.Tokyo has currently the world\\'s largest underground floodwater diversion facility called the Metropolitan Area Outer Underground Discharge Channel (MAOUDC). It took 13 years to build and was completed in 2006. The MAOUDC is a 6.3 km (3.9 mi) long system of tunnels, 22 meters (72 ft) underground, with 70-meter (230 ft) tall cylindrical tanks, each tank being large enough to fit a space shuttle or the Statue of Liberty. During floods, excess water is collected from rivers and drained to the Edo River. Low-lying areas of Kōtō, Edogawa, Sumida, Katsushika, Taitō and Arakawa near the Arakawa River are most at risk of flooding.\\n\\n\\n=== Climate ===\\nThe former city of Tokyo and the majority of Tokyo prefecture lie in the humid subtropical climate zone (Köppen climate classification: Cfa), with hot, humid summers and mild to cool winters with occasional cold spells. The region, like much of Japan, experiences a one-month seasonal lag. The warmest month is August, which averages 26.9 °C (80.4 °F). The coolest month is January, averaging 5.4 °C (41.7 °F). The record low temperature was −9.2 °C (15.4 °F) on January 13, 1876. The record high was 39.5 °C (103.1 °F) on July 20, 2004. \\nThe record highest low temperature is 30.3 °C (86.5 °F), on August 12, 2013, making Tokyo one of only seven observation sites in Japan that have recorded a low temperature over 30 °C (86.0 °F).Annual rainfall averages nearly 1,600 millimeters (63.0 in), with a wetter summer and a drier winter. The growing season in Tokyo lasts for about 322 days from around mid-February to early January. Snowfall is sporadic, and occurs almost annually. Tokyo often sees typhoons every year, though few are strong. The wettest month since records began in 1876 was October 2004, with 780 millimeters (30 in) of rain, including 270.5 mm (10.65 in) on the ninth of that month. The most recent of four months on record to observe no precipitation is December 1995. Annual precipitation has ranged from 879.5 mm (34.63 in) in 1984 to 2,229.6 mm (87.78 in) in 1938.\\n\\nSee or edit raw graph data.\\nTokyo\\'s climate has warmed significantly since temperature records began in 1876.\\n\\nThe western mountainous area of mainland Tokyo, Okutama also lies in the humid subtropical climate (Köppen classification: Cfa).\\n\\nThe climates of Tokyo\\'s offshore territories vary significantly from those of the city. The climate of Chichijima in Ogasawara village is on the boundary between the tropical savanna climate (Köppen classification: Aw) and the tropical rainforest climate (Köppen classification: Af). It is approximately 1,000 km (621 mi) south of the Greater Tokyo Area, resulting in much different climatic conditions.\\n\\nTokyo\\'s easternmost territory, the island of Minamitorishima in Ogasawara village, is in the tropical savanna climate zone (Köppen classification: Aw). Tokyo\\'s Izu and Ogasawara islands are affected by an average of 5.4 typhoons a year, compared to 3.1 in mainland Kantō.\\n\\n\\n== Cityscape ==\\nArchitecture in Tokyo has largely been shaped by Tokyo\\'s history. Twice in recent history has the metropolis been left in ruins: first in the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake and later after extensive firebombing in World War II. Because of this, Tokyo\\'s urban landscape consists mainly of modern and contemporary architecture, and older buildings are scarce. Tokyo features many internationally famous forms of modern architecture including Tokyo International Forum, Asahi Beer Hall, Mode Gakuen Cocoon Tower, NTT Docomo Yoyogi Building and Rainbow Bridge. Tokyo features two distinctive towers: Tokyo Tower and Tokyo Skytree, the latter of which is the tallest tower in both Japan and the world, and the second tallest structure in the world after the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. Mori Building Co started work on Tokyo\\'s new tallest building which was set to be finished in March 2023. The project will cost 580 billion yen ($5.5 billion).Tokyo contains numerous parks and gardens. There are four national parks in Tokyo Prefecture, including the Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park, which includes all of the Izu Islands.\\n\\n\\n== Environment ==\\nTokyo has enacted a measure to cut greenhouse gases. Governor Shintaro Ishihara created Japan\\'s first emissions cap system, aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emission by a total of 25% by 2020 from the 2000 level. Tokyo is an example of an urban heat island, and the phenomenon is especially serious in its special wards. According to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, the annual mean temperature has increased by about 3 °C (5.4 °F) over the past 100 years. Tokyo has been cited as a \"convincing example of the relationship between urban growth and climate\".In 2006, Tokyo enacted the \"10 Year Project for Green Tokyo\" to be realized by 2016. It set a goal of increasing roadside trees in Tokyo to 1 million (from 480,000), and adding 1,000 ha (2,500 acres) of green space, 88 ha (220 acres) of which will be a new park named \"Umi no Mori\" (Sea Forest) which will be on a reclaimed island in Tokyo Bay which used to be a landfill. From 2007 to 2010, 436 ha (1,080 acres) of the planned 1,000 ha of green space was created and 220,000 trees were planted, bringing the total to 700,000. As of 2014, roadside trees in Tokyo have increased to 950,000, and a further 300 ha (740 acres) of green space has been added.\\n\\n\\n== Demographics ==\\nAs of October 2012, the official intercensal estimate showed 13.506 million people in Tokyo, with 9.214 million living within Tokyo\\'s 23 wards. During the daytime, the population swells by over 2.5 million as workers and students commute from adjacent areas. This effect is even more pronounced in the three central wards of Chiyoda, Chūō, and Minato, whose collective population as of the 2005 National Census was 326,000 at night, but 2.4 million during the day.In 1889, the Home Ministry recorded 1,375,937 people in Tokyo City and a total of 1,694,292 people in Tokyo-fu. In the same year, a total of 779 foreign nationals were recorded as residing in Tokyo. The most common nationality was English (209 residents), followed by American (182) and Chinese nationals (137).\\n\\n\\n== Economy ==\\nTokyo has the largest metropolitan economy in the world. According to a study conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers, the Greater Tokyo Area (Tokyo–Yokohama, TYO) of 38 million people had a total GDP of $2 trillion in 2012 (at purchasing power parity), which topped that list.\\nTokyo is a major international finance center; it houses the headquarters of several of the world\\'s largest investment banks and insurance companies, and serves as a hub for Japan\\'s transportation, publishing, electronics and broadcasting industries. During the centralized growth of Japan\\'s economy following World War II, many large firms moved their headquarters from cities such as Osaka (the historical commercial capital) to Tokyo, in an attempt to take advantage of better access to the government. This trend has begun to slow due to ongoing population growth in Tokyo and the high cost of living there.\\nTokyo was rated by the Economist Intelligence Unit as the most expensive (highest cost-of-living) city in the world for 14 years in a row ending in 2006, when it was replaced by Oslo, and later Paris.Tokyo emerged as a leading international financial center (IFC) in the 1960s and has been described as one of the three \"command centers\" for the world economy, along with New York City and London. In the 2020 Global Financial Centers Index, Tokyo was ranked as having the fourth most competitive financial center in the world (alongside cities such as New York City, London, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore, Beijing, San Francisco, Shenzhen and Zurich in the top 10), and second most competitive in Asia (after Shanghai). The Japanese financial market opened up slowly in 1984 and accelerated its internationalization with the \"Japanese Big Bang\" in 1998. Despite the emergence of Singapore and Hong Kong as competing financial centers, the Tokyo IFC manages to keep a prominent position in Asia. The Tokyo Stock Exchange is Japan\\'s largest stock exchange, and third largest in the world by market capitalization and fourth largest by share turnover. In 1990 at the end of the Japanese asset price bubble, it accounted for more than 60% of the world stock market value. Tokyo had 8,460 hectares (20,900 acres) of agricultural land as of 2003, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, placing it last among the nation\\'s prefectures. The farmland is concentrated in Western Tokyo. Perishables such as vegetables, fruits, and flowers can be conveniently shipped to the markets in the eastern part of the prefecture. Komatsuna and spinach are the most important vegetables; as of 2000, Tokyo supplied 32.5% of the komatsuna sold at its central produce market.With 36% of its area covered by forest, Tokyo has extensive growths of cryptomeria and Japanese cypress, especially in the mountainous western communities of Akiruno, Ōme, Okutama, Hachiōji, Hinode, and Hinohara. Decreases in the price of timber, increases in the cost of production, and advancing old age among the forestry population have resulted in a decline in Tokyo\\'s output. In addition, pollen, especially from cryptomeria, is a major allergen for the nearby population centers. Tokyo Bay was once a major source of fish. Most of Tokyo\\'s fish production comes from the outer islands, such as Izu Ōshima and Hachijō-Jima. Skipjack tuna, nori, and aji are among the ocean products.Tourism in Tokyo is also a contributor to the economy. In 2006, 4.81 million foreigners and 420 million Japanese visits to Tokyo were made; the economic value of these visits totaled 9.4 trillion yen according to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. Many tourists visit the various downtowns, stores, and entertainment districts throughout the neighborhoods of the special wards of Tokyo. Cultural offerings include both omnipresent Japanese pop culture and associated districts such as Shibuya and Harajuku, subcultural attractions such as Studio Ghibli anime center, as well as museums like the Tokyo National Museum, which houses 37% of the country\\'s artwork national treasures (87/233).\\nThe Toyosu Market in Tokyo is the largest wholesale fish and seafood market in the world since it opened on October 11, 2018. It is also one of the largest wholesale food markets of any kind. It is located in the Toyosu area of Kōtō ward. The Toyosu Market holds strong to the traditions of its predecessor, the Tsukiji Fish Market and Nihonbashi fish market, and serves some 50,000 buyers and sellers every day. Retailers, whole-sellers, auctioneers, and public citizens alike frequent the market, creating a unique microcosm of organized chaos that still continues to fuel the city and its food supply after over four centuries.\\n\\n\\n== Transportation ==\\n\\nTokyo, which is the center of the Greater Tokyo Area, is Japan\\'s largest domestic and international hub for rail and ground transportation. Public transportation within Tokyo is dominated by an extensive network of \"clean and efficient\" trains and subways run by a variety of operators, with buses, monorails and trams playing a secondary feeder role. There are up to 62 electric train lines and more than 900 train stations in Tokyo. Shibuya Crossing is the \"world\\'s busiest pedestrian crossing\", with around 3,000 people crossing at a time.Narita International Airport in Chiba Prefecture is the major gateway for international travelers to Japan. Japan\\'s flag carrier Japan Airlines, as well as All Nippon Airways, have a hub at this airport. Haneda Airport on the reclaimed land at Ōta, offers domestic and international flights.\\nVarious islands governed by Tokyo have their own airports. Hachijō-jima (Hachijojima Airport), Miyakejima (Miyakejima Airport), and Izu Ōshima (Oshima Airport) have services to Tokyo International and other airports.\\nRail is the primary mode of transportation in Tokyo, which has the most extensive urban railway network in the world and an equally extensive network of surface lines. JR East operates Tokyo\\'s largest railway network, including the Yamanote Line loop that circles the center of downtown Tokyo. It operates rail lines in the entire metropolitan area of Tokyo and in the rest of the northeastern part of Honshu. JR East is also responsible for Shinkansen high-speed rail lines.\\nTwo different organizations operate the subway network: the private Tokyo Metro and the governmental Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Transportation. The Metropolitan Government and private carriers operate bus routes and one tram route. Local, regional, and national services are available, with major terminals at the giant railroad stations, including Tokyo, Shinagawa, and Shinjuku.\\nExpressways link the capital to other points in the Greater Tokyo Area, the Kantō region, and the islands of Kyushu and Shikoku. To build them quickly before the 1964 Summer Olympics, most were constructed above existing roads. Other transportation includes taxis operating in the special wards and the cities and towns. Also, long-distance ferries serve the islands of Tokyo and carry passengers and cargo to domestic and foreign ports.\\n\\n\\n== Education ==\\n\\nTokyo has many universities, junior colleges, and vocational schools. Many of Japan\\'s most prestigious universities are in Tokyo, including University of Tokyo, Hitotsubashi University, Meiji University, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Waseda University, Tokyo University of Science, Sophia University, and Keio University. Some of the biggest national universities in Tokyo are:\\n\\nThere is only one non-national public university: Tokyo Metropolitan University. There are also a few universities well known for classes conducted in English and for the teaching of the Japanese language, including the Globis University Graduate School of Management, International Christian University, Sophia University, and Waseda University\\nTokyo is also the headquarters of the United Nations University.\\nMost publicly run kindergartens, elementary schools (years 1 through 6), and junior high (lower secondary) schools (7 through 9) are operated by local wards or municipal offices. Most public senior high (upper secondary) schools in Tokyo are run by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Board of Education and are called \"Metropolitan High Schools\". Tokyo also has many private schools from kindergarten through high school:\\n\\n\\n== Culture ==\\nTokyo has many museums. In Ueno Park, there is the Tokyo National Museum, the country\\'s largest museum and specializing in traditional Japanese art; the National Museum of Western Art and Ueno Zoo. Other museums include the National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation in Odaiba; the Edo-Tokyo Museum in Sumida, across the Sumida River from the center of Tokyo; the Nezu Museum in Aoyama; and the National Diet Library, National Archives, and the National Museum of Modern Art, which are near the Imperial Palace.\\nTokyo has many theaters for performing arts. These include national and private theaters for traditional forms of Japanese drama. Noteworthy are the National Noh Theatre for noh and the Kabuki-za for Kabuki. Symphony orchestras and other musical organizations perform modern and traditional music. The New National Theater Tokyo in Shibuya is the national center for the performing arts, including opera, ballet, contemporary dance and drama. Tokyo also hosts modern Japanese and international pop, and rock music at venues ranging in size from intimate clubs to internationally known areas such as the Nippon Budokan.\\n\\nMany different festivals occur throughout Tokyo. Major events include the Sannō at Hie Shrine, the Sanja at Asakusa Shrine, and the biennial Kanda Festivals. The last features a parade with elaborately decorated floats and thousands of people. Annually on the last Saturday of July, an enormous fireworks display over the Sumida River attracts over a million viewers. Once cherry blossoms bloom in spring, many residents gather in Ueno Park, Inokashira Park, and the Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden for picnics under the blossoms.\\nHarajuku, a neighborhood in Shibuya, is known internationally for its youth style, fashion and cosplay.\\nIn November 2007, Michelin released their first guide for fine dining in Tokyo, awarding 191 stars in total, or about twice as many as Tokyo\\'s nearest competitor, Paris. As of 2017, 227 restaurants in Tokyo have been awarded (92 in Paris). Twelve establishments were awarded the maximum of three stars (Paris has 10), 54 received two stars, and 161 earned one star.\\n\\n\\n== Sports ==\\n\\nTokyo, with a diverse array of sports, is home to two professional baseball clubs, the Yomiuri Giants who play at the Tokyo Dome and Tokyo Yakult Swallows at Meiji-Jingu Stadium. The Japan Sumo Association is also headquartered in Tokyo at the Ryōgoku Kokugikan sumo arena where three official sumo tournaments are held annually (in January, May, and September). Soccer clubs in Tokyo include F.C. Tokyo and Tokyo Verdy 1969, both of which play at Ajinomoto Stadium in Chōfu, and FC Machida Zelvia at Nozuta Stadium in Machida. Rugby Union is also played in Tokyo, with multiple Japan Rugby League One clubs based in the city including: Black Rams Tokyo (Setagaya), Tokyo Sungoliath (Fuchū) and Toshiba Brave Lupus Tokyo (Fuchū).\\nBasketball clubs include the Hitachi SunRockers, Toyota Alvark Tokyo and Tokyo Excellence.\\nTokyo hosted the 1964 Summer Olympics, thus becoming the first Asian city to host the Summer Games. The National Stadium, also known as the Olympic Stadium, was host to a number of international sporting events. In 2016, it was to be replaced by the New National Stadium. With a number of world-class sports venues, Tokyo often hosts national and international sporting events such as basketball tournaments, women\\'s volleyball tournaments, tennis tournaments, swim meets, marathons, rugby union and sevens rugby games, soccer exhibition games, judo, and karate. Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium, in Sendagaya, Shibuya, is a large sports complex that includes swimming pools, training rooms, and a large indoor arena. According to Around the Rings, the gymnasium has played host to the October 2011 artistic gymnastics world championships, despite the International Gymnastics Federation\\'s initial doubt in Tokyo\\'s ability to host the championships following the March 11 tsunami. Tokyo was also selected to host a number of games for the 2019 Rugby World Cup, and to host the 2020 Summer Olympics and the Paralympics which had to be rescheduled to the summer of 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan.\\n\\n\\n== In popular culture ==\\nAs the largest population center in Japan and the site of the country\\'s largest broadcasters and studios, Tokyo is frequently the setting for many Japanese movies, television shows, animated series\\' (anime), web comics, light novels, video games, and comic books (manga). In the kaiju (monster movie) genre, landmarks of Tokyo are usually destroyed by giant monsters such as Godzilla and Gamera.\\nTokyo is also a popular foreign setting for non-Japanese media. Some Hollywood directors have turned to Tokyo as a backdrop for movies set in Japan. Postwar examples include Tokyo Joe, My Geisha, Tokyo Story and the James Bond film You Only Live Twice; recent examples include Kill Bill, The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, Lost in Translation, Babel, Inception, The Wolverine and Avengers: Endgame.\\nJapanese author Haruki Murakami has based some of his novels in Tokyo (including Norwegian Wood), and David Mitchell\\'s first two novels (number9dream and Ghostwritten) featured the city. Contemporary British painter Carl Randall spent 10 years living in Tokyo as an artist, creating a body of work depicting the city\\'s crowded streets and public spaces.\\n\\n\\n== International relations ==\\nTokyo is the founding member of the Asian Network of Major Cities 21 and is a member of the Council of Local Authorities for International Relations. Tokyo was also a founding member of the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group.\\n\\n\\n=== Sister cities and states ===\\n\\nAs of 2022, Tokyo has twinning or friendship agreements with the following twelve cities and states:\\n\\n\\n=== Friendship and cooperation agreements ===\\nTomsk Oblast, Russia (since May 2015)\\nBrussels, Belgium (since October 2016)\\nMumbai, India (since November 2016)\\nLos Angeles County, United States (since August 2021)\\n\\n\\n=== International academic and scientific research ===\\nResearch and development in Japan and the Japanese space program are globally represented by several of Tokyo\\'s medical and scientific facilities, including the University of Tokyo and other universities in Tokyo, which work in collaboration with many international institutions. Especially with the United States, including NASA and the many private spaceflight companies, Tokyo universities have working relationships with all of the Ivy League institutions (including Harvard and Yale University), along with other research universities and development laboratories, such as Stanford, MIT, and the UC campuses throughout California, as well as UNM and Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Other partners worldwide include Oxford University in the United Kingdom, the National University of Singapore in Singapore, the University of Toronto in Canada, and Tsinghua University in China.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Bibliography ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\n\\n\\n=== Guides ===\\nBender, Andrew, and Timothy N.

It is separated from Great Britain to its east by the North Channel, the Irish Sea, and St George\\'s Channel. Ireland is the second-largest island of the British Isles, the third-largest in Europe, and the twentieth-largest in the world.Geopolitically, the island of Ireland is divided between the Republic of Ireland (officially named Ireland), an independent state covering five-sixths of the island, and Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom. As of 2022, the population of the entire island is just over 7 million, with 5.1 million living in the Republic of Ireland and 1.9 million in Northern Ireland, ranking it the second-most populous island in Europe after Great Britain.The geography of Ireland comprises relatively low-lying mountains surrounding a central plain, with several navigable rivers extending inland. Its lush vegetation is a product of its mild but changeable climate which is free of extremes in temperature. Much of Ireland was woodland until the end of the Middle Ages. Today, woodland makes up about 10% of the island, compared with a European average of over 33%, with most of it being non-native conifer plantations. The Irish climate is influenced by the Atlantic Ocean and thus very moderate, and winters are milder than expected for such a northerly area, although summers are cooler than those in continental Europe. Rainfall and cloud cover are abundant.\\nGaelic Ireland had emerged by the 1st century AD. The island was Christianised from the 5th century onwards. Following the 12th century Anglo-Norman invasion, England claimed sovereignty. However, English rule did not extend over the whole island until the 16th–17th century Tudor conquest, which led to colonisation by settlers from Britain. In the 1690s, a system of Protestant English rule was designed to materially disadvantage the Catholic majority and Protestant dissenters, and was extended during the 18th century. With the Acts of Union in 1801, Ireland became a part of the United Kingdom. A war of independence in the early 20th century was followed by the partition of the island, leading to the creation of the Irish Free State, which became increasingly sovereign over the following decades, and Northern Ireland, which remained a part of the United Kingdom. Northern Ireland saw much civil unrest from the late 1960s until the 1990s. This subsided following the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. In 1973, both the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom, with Northern Ireland as part of it, joined the European Economic Community. Following a referendum vote in 2016, the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland included, left the European Union (EU) in 2020. Northern Ireland was granted a limited special status and allowed to operate within the EU single market for goods without being in the European Union; the economy has subsequently grown faster than the rest of the UK.Irish culture has had a significant influence on other cultures, especially in the field of literature. Alongside mainstream Western culture, a strong indigenous culture exists, as expressed through Gaelic games, Irish music, Irish language, and Irish dance. The island\\'s culture shares many features with that of Great Britain, including the English language, and sports such as association football, rugby, horse racing, golf, and boxing.\\n\\n\\n== Etymology ==\\nThe names Ireland and Éire derive from Old Irish Ériu, a goddess in Irish mythology first recorded in the ninth century. The etymology of Ériu is disputed but may derive from the Proto-Indo-European root *h2uer, referring to flowing water.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Prehistoric Ireland ===\\n\\nDuring the last glacial period, and until about 16,000 BC, much of Ireland was periodically covered in ice. The relative sea level was less than 50m lower resulting in an ice bridge (but not a land bridge) forming between Ireland and Great Britain. By 14,000 BC this ice bridge existed only between Northern Ireland and Scotland and by 12,000 BC Ireland was completely separated from Great Britain. Later, around 6100 BC, Great Britain became separated from continental Europe. Until recently, the earliest evidence of human activity in Ireland was dated at 12,500 years ago, demonstrated by a butchered bear bone found in a cave in County Clare. Since 2021, the earliest evidence of human activity in Ireland is dated to 33,000 years ago.By about 8000 BC, more sustained occupation of the island has been shown, with evidence for Mesolithic communities around the island.Some time before 4000 BC, Neolithic settlers introduced cereal cultivars, domesticated animals such as cattle and sheep, built large timber buildings, and stone monuments. The earliest evidence for farming in Ireland or Great Britain is from Ferriter\\'s Cove, County Kerry, where a flint knife, cattle bones and a sheep\\'s tooth were carbon-dated to c. 4350 BC. Field systems were developed in different parts of Ireland, including at the Céide Fields, that has been preserved beneath a blanket of peat in present-day Tyrawley. An extensive field system, arguably the oldest in the world, consisted of small divisions separated by dry-stone walls. The fields were farmed for several centuries between 3500 BC and 3000 BC. Wheat and barley were the principal crops.The Bronze Age began around 2500 BC, with technology changing people\\'s everyday lives during this period through innovations such as the wheel; harnessing oxen; weaving textiles; brewing alcohol; and skillful metalworking, which produced new weapons and tools, along with fine gold decoration and jewellery, such as brooches and torcs.\\n\\n\\n==== Emergence of Celtic Ireland ====\\nHow and when the island became Celtic has been debated for close to a century, with the migrations of the Celts being one of the more enduring themes of archaeological and linguistic studies. The most recent genetic research strongly associates the spread of Indo-European languages (including Celtic) through Western Europe with a people bringing a composite Beaker culture, with its arrival in Britain and Ireland dated to around the middle of the third millennium BC. According to John T. Koch and others, Ireland in the Late Bronze Age was part of a maritime trading-network culture called the Atlantic Bronze Age that also included Britain, western France and Iberia, and that this is where Celtic languages developed. This contrasts with the traditional view that their origin lies in mainland Europe with the Hallstatt culture.\\nThe long-standing traditional view is that the Celtic language, Ogham script and culture were brought to Ireland by waves of invading or migrating Celts from mainland Europe. This theory draws on the Lebor Gabála Érenn, a medieval Christian pseudo-history of Ireland, along with the presence of Celtic culture, language and artefacts found in Ireland such as Celtic bronze spears, shields, torcs and other finely crafted Celtic associated possessions. The theory holds that there were four separate Celtic invasions of Ireland. The Priteni were said to be the first, followed by the Belgae from northern Gaul and Britain. Later, Laighin tribes from Armorica (present-day Brittany) were said to have invaded Ireland and Britain more or less simultaneously. Lastly, the Milesians (Gaels) were said to have reached Ireland from either northern Iberia or southern Gaul. It was claimed that a second wave named the Euerni, belonging to the Belgae people of northern Gaul, began arriving about the sixth century BC. They were said to have given their name to the island.The theory was advanced in part because of the lack of archaeological evidence for large-scale Celtic immigration, though it is accepted that such movements are notoriously difficult to identify. Historical linguists are skeptical that this method alone could account for the absorption of Celtic language, with some saying that an assumed processual view of Celtic linguistic formation is \\'an especially hazardous exercise\\'. Genetic lineage investigation into the area of Celtic migration to Ireland has led to findings that showed no significant differences in mitochondrial DNA between Ireland and large areas of continental Europe, in contrast to parts of the Y-chromosome pattern. When taking both into account, a study concluded that modern Celtic speakers in Ireland could be thought of as European \"Atlantic Celts\" showing a shared ancestry throughout the Atlantic zone from northern Iberia to western Scandinavia rather than substantially central European.\\nIn 2012, research showed that the occurrence of genetic markers for the earliest farmers was almost eliminated by Beaker-culture immigrants: they carried what was then a new Y-chromosome R1b marker, believed to have originated in Iberia about 2500 BC. The prevalence amongst modern Irish men of this mutation is a remarkable 84%, the highest in the world, and closely matched in other populations along the Atlantic fringes down to Spain. A similar genetic replacement happened with lineages in mitochondrial DNA. This conclusion is supported by recent research carried out by the geneticist David Reich, who says: \"British and Irish skeletons from the Bronze Age that followed the Beaker period had at most 10 per cent ancestry from the first farmers of these islands, with other 90 per cent from people like those associated with the Bell Beaker culture in the Netherlands.\" He suggests that it was Beaker users who introduced an Indo-European language, represented here by Celtic (i.e. a new language and culture introduced directly by migration and genetic replacement).\\n\\n\\n=== Late antiquity and early medieval times ===\\n\\nThe earliest written records of Ireland come from classical Greco-Roman geographers. Ptolemy in his Almagest refers to Ireland as Mikra Brettania (\"Little Britain\"), in contrast to the larger island, which he called Megale Brettania (\"Great Britain\"). In his later work, Geography, Ptolemy refers to Ireland as Iouernia and to Great Britain as Albion. These \\'new\\' names were likely to have been the local names for the islands at the time. The earlier names, in contrast, were likely to have been coined before direct contact with local peoples was made.The Romans referred to Ireland by this name too in its Latinised form, Hibernia, or Scotia. Ptolemy records sixteen nations inhabiting every part of Ireland in 100 AD. The relationship between the Roman Empire and the kingdoms of ancient Ireland is unclear. However, a number of finds of Roman coins have been made, for example at the Iron Age settlement of Freestone Hill near Gowran and Newgrange.Ireland continued as a patchwork of rival kingdoms; however, beginning in the 7th century, a concept of national kingship gradually became articulated through the concept of a High King of Ireland. Medieval Irish literature portrays an almost unbroken sequence of high kings stretching back thousands of years, but modern historians believe the scheme was constructed in the 8th century to justify the status of powerful political groupings by projecting the origins of their rule into the remote past.All of the Irish kingdoms had their own kings but were nominally subject to the high king. The high king was drawn from the ranks of the provincial kings and ruled also the royal kingdom of Meath, with a ceremonial capital at the Hill of Tara. The concept did not become a political reality until the Viking Age and even then was not a consistent one. Ireland did have a culturally unifying rule of law: the early written judicial system, the Brehon Laws, administered by a professional class of jurists known as the brehons.The Chronicle of Ireland records that in 431, Bishop Palladius arrived in Ireland on a mission from Pope Celestine I to minister to the Irish \"already believing in Christ\". The same chronicle records that Saint Patrick, Ireland\\'s best known patron saint, arrived the following year. There is continued debate over the missions of Palladius and Patrick, but the consensus is that they both took place and that the older druid tradition collapsed in the face of the new religion. Irish Christian scholars excelled in the study of Latin and Greek learning and Christian theology. In the monastic culture that followed the Christianisation of Ireland, Latin and Greek learning was preserved in Ireland during the Early Middle Ages in contrast to elsewhere in Western Europe, where the Dark Ages followed the Fall of the Western Roman Empire.\\nThe arts of manuscript illumination, metalworking and sculpture flourished and produced treasures such as the Book of Kells, ornate jewellery and the many carved stone crosses that still dot the island today. A mission founded in 563 on Iona by the Irish monk Saint Columba began a tradition of Irish missionary work that spread Celtic Christianity and learning to Scotland, England and the Frankish Empire on continental Europe after the fall of Rome. These missions continued until the late Middle Ages, establishing monasteries and centres of learning, producing scholars such as Sedulius Scottus and Johannes Eriugena and exerting much influence in Europe.From the 9th century, waves of Viking raiders plundered Irish monasteries and towns. These raids added to a pattern of raiding and endemic warfare that was already deep-seated in Ireland. The Vikings were involved in establishing most of the major coastal settlements in Ireland: Dublin, Limerick, Cork, Wexford, Waterford, as well as other smaller settlements.\\n\\n\\n=== Norman and English invasions ===\\n\\nOn 1 May 1169, an expedition of Cambro-Norman knights, with an army of about 600 men, landed at Bannow Strand in present-day County Wexford. It was led by Richard de Clare, known as \\'Strongbow\\' owing to his prowess as an archer. The invasion, which coincided with a period of renewed Norman expansion, was at the invitation of Dermot Mac Murrough, King of Leinster.In 1166, Mac Murrough had fled to Anjou, France, following a war involving Tighearnán Ua Ruairc, of Breifne, and sought the assistance of the Angevin King Henry II, in recapturing his kingdom. In 1171, Henry arrived in Ireland in order to review the general progress of the expedition. He wanted to re-exert royal authority over the invasion which was expanding beyond his control. Henry successfully re-imposed his authority over Strongbow and the Cambro-Norman warlords and persuaded many of the Irish kings to accept him as their overlord, an arrangement confirmed in the 1175 Treaty of Windsor.\\nThe invasion was legitimised by reference to provisions of the alleged Papal Bull Laudabiliter, issued by an Englishman, Adrian IV, in 1155. The document apparently encouraged Henry to take control in Ireland in order to oversee the financial and administrative reorganisation of the Irish Church and its integration into the Roman Church system. Some restructuring had already begun at the ecclesiastical level following the Synod of Kells in 1152. There has been significant controversy regarding the authenticity of Laudabiliter, and there is no general agreement as to whether the bull was genuine or a forgery. Further, it had no standing in the Irish legal system.\\n\\nIn 1172, Pope Alexander III further encouraged Henry to advance the integration of the Irish Church with Rome. Henry was authorised to impose a tithe of one penny per hearth as an annual contribution. This church levy called Peter\\'s Pence, is extant in Ireland as a voluntary donation. In turn, Henry assumed the title of Lord of Ireland which Henry conferred on his younger son, John Lackland, in 1185. This defined the Anglo-Norman administration in Ireland as the Lordship of Ireland. When Henry\\'s successor died unexpectedly in 1199, John inherited the crown of England and retained the Lordship of Ireland. Over the century that followed, Norman feudal law gradually replaced the Gaelic Brehon Law across large areas, so that by the late 13th century the Norman-Irish had established a feudal system throughout much of Ireland. Norman settlements were characterised by the establishment of baronies, manors, towns and the seeds of the modern county system. A version of the Magna Carta (the Great Charter of Ireland), substituting Dublin for London and the Irish Church for, the English church at the time, the Catholic Church, was published in 1216 and the Parliament of Ireland was founded in 1297.\\n\\n\\n=== Gaelicisation ===\\nFrom the mid-14th century, after the Black Death, Norman settlements in Ireland went into a period of decline. The Norman rulers and the Gaelic Irish elites intermarried and the areas under Norman rule became Gaelicised. In some parts, a hybrid Hiberno-Norman culture emerged. In response, the Irish parliament passed the Statutes of Kilkenny in 1367. These were a set of laws designed to prevent the assimilation of the Normans into Irish society by requiring English subjects in Ireland to speak English, follow English customs and abide by English law.By the end of the 15th century, central English authority in Ireland had all but disappeared, and a renewed Irish culture and language, albeit with Norman influences, was again dominant. English Crown control remained relatively unshaken in an amorphous foothold around Dublin known as The Pale, and under the provisions of Poynings\\' Law of 1494, Irish Parliamentary legislation was subject to the approval of the English Privy Council.\\n\\n\\n=== The Kingdom of Ireland ===\\n\\nThe title of King of Ireland was re-created in 1542 by Henry VIII, the then King of England, of the Tudor dynasty. English rule was reinforced and expanded in Ireland during the latter part of the 16th century, leading to the Tudor conquest of Ireland. A near-complete conquest was achieved by the turn of the 17th century, following the Nine Years\\' War and the Flight of the Earls.\\nThis control was consolidated during the wars and conflicts of the 17th century, including the English and Scottish colonisation in the Plantations of Ireland, the Wars of the Three Kingdoms and the Williamite War. Irish losses during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms (which, in Ireland, included the Irish Confederacy and the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland) are estimated to include 20,000 battlefield casualties. 200,000 civilians are estimated to have died as a result of a combination of war-related famine, displacement, guerrilla activity and pestilence throughout the war. A further 50,000 were sent into indentured servitude in the West Indies. Physician-general William Petty estimated that 504,000 Catholic Irish and 112,000 Protestant settlers died, and 100,000 people were transported, as a result of the war. If a prewar population of 1.5 million is assumed, this would mean that the population was reduced by almost half.\\nThe religious struggles of the 17th century left a deep sectarian division in Ireland. Religious allegiance now determined the perception in law of loyalty to the Irish King and Parliament. After the passing of the Test Act 1672, and the victory of the forces of the dual monarchy of William and Mary over the Jacobites, Roman Catholics and nonconforming Protestant Dissenters were barred from sitting as members in the Irish Parliament. Under the emerging Penal Laws, Irish Roman Catholics and Dissenters were increasingly deprived of various civil rights, even the ownership of hereditary property. Additional regressive punitive legislation followed in 1703, 1709 and 1728. This completed a comprehensive systemic effort to materially disadvantage Roman Catholics and Protestant Dissenters while enriching a new ruling class of Anglican conformists. The new Anglo-Irish ruling class became known as the Protestant Ascendancy.\\n\\nThe \"Great Frost\" struck Ireland and the rest of Europe between December 1739 and September 1741, after a decade of relatively mild winters. The winters destroyed stored crops of potatoes and other staples, and the poor summers severely damaged harvests. This resulted in the famine of 1740. An estimated 250,000 people (about one in eight of the population) died from the ensuing pestilence and disease. The Irish government halted export of corn and kept the army in quarters but did little more. Local gentry and charitable organisations provided relief but could do little to prevent the ensuing mortality.In the aftermath of the famine, an increase in industrial production and a surge in trade brought a succession of construction booms. The population soared in the latter part of this century and the architectural legacy of Georgian Ireland was built. In 1782, Poynings\\' Law was repealed, giving Ireland legislative independence from Great Britain for the first time since 1495. The British government, however, still retained the right to nominate the government of Ireland without the consent of the Irish parliament.\\n\\n\\n=== Union with Great Britain ===\\n\\nIn 1798, members of the Protestant Dissenter tradition (mainly Presbyterian) made common cause with Roman Catholics in a republican rebellion inspired and led by the Society of United Irishmen, with the aim of creating an independent Ireland. Despite assistance from France the rebellion was put down by British and Irish government and yeomanry forces. In 1800, the British and Irish parliaments both passed Acts of Union that, with effect from 1 January 1801, merged the Kingdom of Ireland and the Kingdom of Great Britain to create a United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.The passage of the Act in the Irish Parliament was ultimately achieved with substantial majorities, having failed on the first attempt in 1799. According to contemporary documents and historical analysis, this was achieved through a considerable degree of bribery, with funding provided by the British Secret Service Office, and the awarding of peerages, places and honours to secure votes. Thus, the parliament in Ireland was abolished and replaced by a united parliament at Westminster in London, though resistance remained, as evidenced by Robert Emmet\\'s failed Irish Rebellion of 1803.\\nAside from the development of the linen industry, Ireland was largely passed over by the industrial revolution, partly because it lacked coal and iron resources and partly because of the impact of the sudden union with the structurally superior economy of England, which saw Ireland as a source of agricultural produce and capital.\\nThe Great Famine of 1845–1851 devastated Ireland, as in those years Ireland\\'s population fell by one-third. More than one million people died from starvation and disease, with an additional million people emigrating during the famine, mostly to the United States and Canada. In the century that followed, an economic depression caused by the famine resulted in a further million people emigrating. By the end of the decade, half of all immigration to the United States was from Ireland. The period of civil unrest that followed until the end of the 19th century is referred to as the Land War. Mass emigration became deeply entrenched and the population continued to decline until the mid-20th century. Immediately prior to the famine the population was recorded as 8.2 million by the 1841 census. The population has never returned to this level since. The population continued to fall until 1961; County Leitrim was the final Irish county to record a population increase post-famine, in 2006.\\nThe 19th and early 20th centuries saw the rise of modern Irish nationalism, primarily among the Roman Catholic population. The pre-eminent Irish political figure after the Union was Daniel O\\'Connell. He was elected as Member of Parliament for Ennis in a surprise result and despite being unable to take his seat as a Roman Catholic. O\\'Connell spearheaded a vigorous campaign that was taken up by the Prime Minister, the Irish-born soldier and statesman, the Duke of Wellington. Steering the Catholic Relief Bill through Parliament, aided by future prime minister Robert Peel, Wellington prevailed upon a reluctant George IV to sign the Bill and proclaim it into law. George\\'s father had opposed the plan of the earlier Prime Minister, Pitt the Younger, to introduce such a bill following the Union of 1801, fearing Catholic Emancipation to be in conflict with the Act of Settlement 1701.\\nDaniel O\\'Connell led a subsequent campaign, for the repeal of the Act of Union, which failed. Later in the century, Charles Stewart Parnell and others campaigned for autonomy within the Union, or \"Home Rule\". Unionists, especially those located in Ulster, were strongly opposed to Home Rule, which they thought would be dominated by Catholic interests. After several attempts to pass a Home Rule bill through parliament, it looked certain that one would finally pass in 1914. To prevent this from happening, the Ulster Volunteers were formed in 1913 under the leadership of Edward Carson.Their formation was followed in 1914 by the establishment of the Irish Volunteers, whose aim was to ensure that the Home Rule Bill was passed. The Act was passed but with the \"temporary\" exclusion of the six counties of Ulster, which later became Northern Ireland. Before it could be implemented, however, the Act was suspended for the duration of the First World War. The Irish Volunteers split into two groups. The majority, approximately 175,000 in number, under John Redmond, took the name National Volunteers and supported Irish involvement in the war. A minority, approximately 13,000, retained the Irish Volunteers\\' name and opposed Ireland\\'s involvement in the war.\\nThe Easter Rising of 1916 was carried out by the latter group together with a smaller socialist militia, the Irish Citizen Army. The British response, executing fifteen leaders of the Rising over a period of ten days and imprisoning or interning more than a thousand people, turned the mood of the country in favour of the rebels. Support for Irish republicanism increased further due to the ongoing war in Europe, as well as the Conscription Crisis of 1918.The pro-independence republican party, Sinn Féin, received overwhelming endorsement in the general election of 1918, and in 1919 proclaimed an Irish Republic, setting up its own parliament (Dáil Éireann) and government. Simultaneously the Volunteers, which became known as the Irish Republican Army (IRA), launched a three-year guerrilla war, which ended in a truce in July 1921 (although violence continued until June 1922, mostly in Northern Ireland).\\n\\n\\n=== Partition ===\\n\\nIn December 1921, the Anglo-Irish Treaty was concluded between the British government and representatives of the Second Dáil. It gave Ireland complete independence in its home affairs and practical independence for foreign policy, but an opt-out clause allowed Northern Ireland to remain within the United Kingdom, which it immediately exercised. Additionally, Members of the Free State Parliament were required to swear an oath of allegiance to the Constitution of the Irish Free State and make a statement of faithfulness to the king. Disagreements over these provisions led to a split in the nationalist movement and a subsequent Irish Civil War between the new government of the Irish Free State and those opposed to the treaty, led by Éamon de Valera. The civil war officially ended in May 1923 when de Valera issued a cease-fire order.\\n\\n\\n==== Independence ====\\n\\nDuring its first decade, the newly formed Irish Free State was governed by the victors of the civil war. When de Valera achieved power, he took advantage of the Statute of Westminster and political circumstances to build upon inroads to greater sovereignty made by the previous government. The oath was abolished and in 1937 a new constitution was adopted. This completed a process of gradual separation from the British Empire that governments had pursued since independence. However, it was not until 1949 that the state was declared, officially, to be the Republic of Ireland.\\nThe state was neutral during World War II, but offered clandestine assistance to the Allies, particularly in the potential defence of Northern Ireland. Despite their country\\'s neutrality, approximately 50,000 volunteers from independent Ireland joined the British forces during the war, four being awarded Victoria Crosses.\\nThe German intelligence was also active in Ireland. Its operations ended in September 1941 when police made arrests based on surveillance carried out on the key diplomatic legations in Dublin. To the authorities, counterintelligence was a fundamental line of defence. With a regular army of only slightly over seven thousand men at the start of the war, and with limited supplies of modern weapons, the state would have had great difficulty in defending itself from invasion from either side in the conflict.Large-scale emigration marked most of the post-WWII period (particularly during the 1950s and 1980s), but beginning in 1987 the economy improved, and the 1990s saw the beginning of substantial economic growth. This period of growth became known as the Celtic Tiger. The Republic\\'s real GDP grew by an average of 9.6% per annum between 1995 and 1999, in which year the Republic joined the euro. In 2000, it was the sixth-richest country in the world in terms of GDP per capita. Historian R. F. Foster argues the cause was a combination of a new sense of initiative and the entry of American corporations. He concludes the chief factors were low taxation, pro-business regulatory policies, and a young, tech-savvy workforce. For many multinationals, the decision to do business in Ireland was made easier still by generous incentives from the Industrial Development Authority. In addition European Union membership was helpful, giving the country lucrative access to markets that it had previously reached only through the United Kingdom, and pumping huge subsidies and investment capital into the Irish economy.Modernisation brought secularisation in its wake. The traditionally high levels of religiosity have sharply declined. Foster points to three factors: First, Irish feminism, largely imported from America with liberal stances on contraception, abortion and divorce, undermined the authority of bishops and priests. Second, the mishandling of the paedophile scandals humiliated the Church, whose bishops seemed less concerned with the victims and more concerned with covering up for errant priests. Third, prosperity brought hedonism and materialism that undercut the ideals of saintly poverty.The financial crisis that began in 2008 dramatically ended this period of boom. GDP fell by 3% in 2008 and by 7.1% in 2009, the worst year since records began (although earnings by foreign-owned businesses continued to grow). The state has since experienced deep recession, with unemployment, which doubled during 2009, remaining above 14% in 2012.\\n\\n\\n==== Northern Ireland ====\\n\\nNorthern Ireland resulted from the division of the United Kingdom by the Government of Ireland Act 1920, and until 1972 was a self-governing jurisdiction within the United Kingdom with its own parliament and prime minister. Northern Ireland, as part of the United Kingdom, was not neutral during the Second World War, and Belfast suffered four bombing raids in 1941. Conscription was not extended to Northern Ireland, and roughly an equal number volunteered from Northern Ireland as volunteered from the Republic of Ireland.\\n\\nAlthough Northern Ireland was largely spared the strife of the civil war, in the decades that followed partition there were sporadic episodes of inter-communal violence. Nationalists, mainly Roman Catholic, wanted to unite Ireland as an independent republic, whereas unionists, mainly Protestant, wanted Northern Ireland to remain in the United Kingdom. The Protestant and Catholic communities in Northern Ireland voted largely along sectarian lines, meaning that the government of Northern Ireland (elected by \"first-past-the-post\" from 1929) was controlled by the Ulster Unionist Party. Over time, the minority Catholic community felt increasingly alienated with further disaffection fuelled by practices such as gerrymandering and discrimination in housing and employment.In the late 1960s, nationalist grievances were aired publicly in mass civil rights protests, which were often confronted by loyalist counter-protests. The government\\'s reaction to confrontations was seen to be one-sided and heavy-handed in favour of unionists. Law and order broke down as unrest and inter-communal violence increased. The Northern Ireland government requested the British Army to aid the police and protect the Irish Nationalist population. In 1969, the paramilitary Provisional IRA, which favoured the creation of a united Ireland, emerged from a split in the Irish Republican Army and began a campaign against what it called the \"British occupation of the six counties\".Other groups, both the unionist and nationalist participated in violence, and a period known as \"the Troubles\" began. Over 3,600 deaths resulted over the subsequent three decades of conflict. Owing to the civil unrest during the Troubles, the British government suspended home rule in 1972 and imposed direct rule. There were several unsuccessful attempts to end the Troubles politically, such as the Sunningdale Agreement of 1973. In 1998, following a ceasefire by the Provisional IRA and multi-party talks, the Good Friday Agreement was concluded as a treaty between the British and Irish governments, annexing the text agreed in the multi-party talks.\\nThe substance of the Agreement (formally referred to as the Belfast Agreement) was later endorsed by referendums in both parts of Ireland. The Agreement restored self-government to Northern Ireland on the basis of power-sharing in a regional Executive drawn from the major parties in a new Northern Ireland Assembly, with entrenched protections for the two main communities. The Executive is jointly headed by a First Minister and deputy First Minister drawn from the unionist and nationalist parties. Violence had decreased greatly after the Provisional IRA and loyalist ceasefires in 1994 and in 2005 the Provisional IRA announced the end of its armed campaign and an independent commission supervised its disarmament and that of other nationalist and unionist paramilitary organisations.The Assembly and power-sharing Executive were suspended several times but were restored again in 2007. In that year the British government officially ended its military support of the police in Northern Ireland (Operation Banner) and began withdrawing troops. On 27 June 2012, Northern Ireland\\'s deputy first minister and former IRA commander, Martin McGuinness, shook hands with Queen Elizabeth II in Belfast, symbolising reconciliation between the two sides.\\n\\n\\n== Politics ==\\nThe island is divided between the Republic of Ireland, an independent state, and Northern Ireland, a constituent country of the United Kingdom. They share an open border and both are part of the Common Travel Area and as a consequence, there is free movement of people, goods, services and capital across the border.\\nThe Republic of Ireland is a member state of the European Union while the United Kingdom is a former member state, having both acceded to its precursor entity, the European Economic Community (EEC), in 1973 but the UK left the European Union in 2020 after a referendum on EU membership was held in 2016 which resulted in 51.9% of UK voters choosing to leave the bloc.\\n\\n\\n=== Republic of Ireland ===\\n\\nThe Republic of Ireland is a parliamentary democracy based on the Westminster system, with a written constitution and a popularly elected president whose role is mostly ceremonial. The Oireachtas is a bicameral parliament, composed of Dáil Éireann (the Dáil), a house of representatives, and Seanad Éireann (the Seanad), an upper house. The government is headed by a prime minister, the Taoiseach, who is appointed by the president on the nomination of the Dáil. Its capital is Dublin.\\nThe Republic of Ireland today ranks among the wealthiest countries in the world in terms of GDP per capita and in 2015 was ranked the sixth most developed nation in the world by the United Nations\\' Human Development Index. A period of rapid economic expansion from 1995 onwards became known as the Celtic Tiger period, was brought to an end in 2008 with an unprecedented financial crisis and an economic depression in 2009.\\n\\n\\n=== Northern Ireland ===\\n\\nNorthern Ireland is a part of the United Kingdom with a local executive and assembly which exercise devolved powers. The executive is jointly headed by the first and deputy first minister, with the ministries being allocated in proportion to each party\\'s representation in the assembly. Its capital is Belfast.\\nUltimately political power is held by the UK government, from which Northern Ireland has gone through intermittent periods of direct rule during which devolved powers have been suspended. Northern Ireland elects 18 of the UK House of Commons\\' 650 MPs. The Northern Ireland Secretary is a cabinet-level post in the British government.\\nAlong with England and Wales and with Scotland, Northern Ireland forms one of the three separate legal jurisdictions of the UK, all of which share the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom as their court of final appeal.\\n\\n\\n=== All-island institutions ===\\nAs part of the Good Friday Agreement, the British and Irish governments agreed on the creation of all-island institutions and areas of cooperation. The North/South Ministerial Council is an institution through which ministers from the Government of Ireland and the Northern Ireland Executive agree all-island policies. At least six of these policy areas must have an associated all-island \"implementation body,\" and at least six others must be implemented separately in each jurisdiction. The implementation bodies are: Waterways Ireland, the Food Safety Promotion Board, InterTradeIreland, the Special European Union Programmes Body, the North/South Language Body and the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission.\\nThe British–Irish Intergovernmental Conference provides for co-operation between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the United Kingdom on all matters of mutual interest, especially Northern Ireland. In light of the Republic\\'s particular interest in the governance of Northern Ireland, \"regular and frequent\" meetings co-chaired by the Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs and the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, dealing with non-devolved matters to do with Northern Ireland and non-devolved all-Ireland issues, are required to take place under the establishing treaty.\\nThe North/South Inter-Parliamentary Association is a joint parliamentary forum for the island of Ireland. It has no formal powers but operates as a forum for discussing matters of common concern between the respective legislatures.\\n\\n\\n== Geography ==\\n\\nIreland is located in the north-west of Europe, between latitudes 51° and 56° N, and longitudes 11° and 5° W. It is separated from Great Britain by the Irish Sea and the North Channel, which has a width of 23 kilometres (14 mi) at its narrowest point. To the west is the northern Atlantic Ocean and to the south is the Celtic Sea, which lies between Ireland and Brittany, in France. Ireland has a total area of 84,421 km2 (32,595 sq mi), of which the Republic of Ireland occupies 83 percent. Ireland and Great Britain, together with many nearby smaller islands, are known collectively as the British Isles. As the term British Isles can be controversial in relation to Ireland, the alternate term Britain and Ireland is sometimes used as a neutral term for the islands.A ring of coastal mountains surrounds low plains at the centre of the island. The highest of these is Carrauntoohil (Irish: Corrán Tuathail) in County Kerry, which rises to 1,039 m (3,409 ft) above sea level. The most arable land lies in the province of Leinster. Western areas are mainly mountainous and rocky with green panoramic vistas. River Shannon, the island\\'s longest river at 360.5 km (224 mi) long, rises in County Cavan in the north-west and flows through Limerick in the midwest.\\n\\n\\n=== Geology ===\\n\\nThe island consists of varied geological provinces. In the west, around County Galway and County Donegal, is a medium to high grade metamorphic and igneous complex of Caledonide affinity, similar to the Scottish Highlands. Across southeast Ulster and extending southwest to Longford and south to Navan is a province of Ordovician and Silurian rocks, with similarities to the Southern Uplands province of Scotland. Further south, along the County Wexford coastline, is an area of granite intrusives into more Ordovician and Silurian rocks, like that found in Wales.In the southwest, around Bantry Bay and the mountains of MacGillycuddy\\'s Reeks, is an area of substantially deformed, lightly metamorphosed Devonian-aged rocks. This partial ring of \"hard rock\" geology is covered by a blanket of Carboniferous limestone over the centre of the country, giving rise to a comparatively fertile and lush landscape. The west-coast district of the Burren around Lisdoonvarna has well-developed karst features. Significant stratiform lead-zinc mineralisation is found in the limestones around Silvermines and Tynagh.\\nHydrocarbon exploration is ongoing following the first major find at the Kinsale Head gas field off Cork in the mid-1970s. In 1999, economically significant finds of natural gas were made in the Corrib Gas Field off the County Mayo coast. This has increased activity off the west coast in parallel with the \"West of Shetland\" step-out development from the North Sea hydrocarbon province. In 2000, the Helvick oil field was discovered, which was estimated to contain over 28 million barrels (4,500,000 m3) of oil.\\n\\n\\n=== Climate ===\\n\\nThe island\\'s lush vegetation, a product of its mild climate and frequent rainfall, earns it the sobriquet the Emerald Isle. Overall, Ireland has a mild but changeable oceanic climate with few extremes. The climate is typically insular and temperate, avoiding the extremes in temperature of many other areas in the world at similar latitudes. This is a result of the moist winds which ordinarily prevail from the southwestern Atlantic.\\nPrecipitation falls throughout the year but is light overall, particularly in the east. The west tends to be wetter on average and prone to Atlantic storms, especially in the late autumn and winter months. These occasionally bring destructive winds and higher total rainfall to these areas, as well as sometimes snow and hail. The regions of north County Galway and east County Mayo have the highest incidents of recorded lightning annually for the island, with lightning occurring approximately five to ten days per year in these areas. Munster, in the south, records the least snow whereas Ulster, in the north, records the most.\\nInland areas are warmer in summer and colder in winter. Usually around 40 days of the year are below freezing 0 °C (32 °F) at inland weather stations, compared to 10 days at coastal stations. Ireland is sometimes affected by heat waves, most recently in 1995, 2003, 2006, 2013 and 2018. In common with the rest of Europe, Ireland experienced unusually cold weather during the winter of 2010–11. Temperatures fell as low as −17.2 °C (1 °F) in County Mayo on 20 December and up to a metre (3 ft) of snow fell in mountainous areas.\\n\\n\\n== Flora and fauna ==\\n\\nUnlike Great Britain which had a land bridge with mainland Europe, Ireland only had an ice bridge ending around 14,000 years ago at the end of the last ice age and as a result, it has fewer land animal and plant species than Great Britain or mainland Europe. There are 55 mammal species in Ireland, and of them, only 26 land mammal species are considered native to Ireland. Some species, such as, the red fox, hedgehog and badger, are very common, whereas others, like the Irish hare, red deer and pine marten are less so. Aquatic wildlife, such as species of sea turtle, shark, seal, whale, and dolphin, are common off the coast. About 400 species of birds have been recorded in Ireland. Many of these are migratory, including the barn swallow.\\n\\nSeveral different habitat types are found in Ireland, including farmland, open woodland, temperate broadleaf and mixed forests, conifer plantations, peat bogs and a variety of coastal habitats. However, agriculture drives current land use patterns in Ireland, limiting natural habitat preserves, particularly for larger wild mammals with greater territorial needs. With no large apex predators in Ireland other than humans and dogs, such populations of animals as semi-wild deer that cannot be controlled by smaller predators, such as the fox, are controlled by annual culling.\\nThere are no snakes in Ireland, and only one species of reptile (the common lizard) is native to the island. Extinct species include the Irish elk, the great auk, brown bear and the wolf. Some previously extinct birds, such as the golden eagle, have been reintroduced after decades of extirpation.Ireland is now one of the least forested countries in Europe. Until the end of the Middle Ages, Ireland was heavily forested. Native species include deciduous trees such as oak, ash, hazel, birch, alder, willow, aspen, rowan and hawthorn, as well as evergreen trees such Scots pine, yew, holly and strawberry trees. Only about 10% of Ireland today is woodland; most of this is non-native conifer plantations, and only 2% is native woodland. The average woodland cover of European countries is over 33%. In the Republic, about 389,356 hectares (3,893.56 km2) is owned by the state, mainly by the forestry service Coillte. Remnants of native forest can be found scattered around the island, in particular in the Killarney National Park.\\n\\nMuch of the land is now covered with pasture and there are many species of wild-flower. Gorse (Ulex europaeus), a wild furze, is commonly found growing in the uplands and ferns are plentiful in the more moist regions, especially in the western parts. It is home to hundreds of plant species, some of them unique to the island, and has been \"invaded\" by some grasses, such as Spartina anglica.The algal and seaweed flora is that of the cold-temperate variety. The total number of species is 574 The island has been invaded by some algae, some of which are now well established.Because of its mild climate, many species, including sub-tropical species such as palm trees, are grown in Ireland. Phytogeographically, Ireland belongs to the Atlantic European province of the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom. The island can be subdivided into two ecoregions: the Celtic broadleaf forests and North Atlantic moist mixed forests.\\n\\n\\n=== Impact of agriculture ===\\nThe long history of agricultural production, coupled with modern intensive agricultural methods such as pesticide and fertiliser use and runoff from contaminants into streams, rivers and lakes, has placed pressure on biodiversity in Ireland. A land of green fields for crop cultivation and cattle rearing limits the space available for the establishment of native wild species. Hedgerows, however, traditionally used for maintaining and demarcating land boundaries, act as a refuge for native wild flora. This ecosystem stretches across the countryside and acts as a network of connections to preserve remnants of the ecosystem that once covered the island. Subsidies under the Common Agricultural Policy, which supported agricultural practices that preserved hedgerow environments, are undergoing reforms. The Common Agricultural Policy had in the past subsidised potentially destructive agricultural practices, for example by emphasising production without placing limits on indiscriminate use of fertilisers and pesticides; but reforms have gradually decoupled subsidies from production levels and introduced environmental and other requirements. 32% of Ireland\\'s greenhouse gas emissions are correlated to agriculture. Forested areas typically consist of monoculture plantations of non-native species, which may result in habitats that are not suitable for supporting native species of invertebrates. Natural areas require fencing to prevent over-grazing by deer and sheep that roam over uncultivated areas. Grazing in this manner is one of the main factors preventing the natural regeneration of forests across many regions of the country.\\n\\n\\n== Demographics ==\\n\\nThe population of Ireland is just over 7 million, of which approximately 5.1 million reside in the Republic of Ireland and 1.9 million reside in Northern Ireland.People have lived in Ireland for over 9,000 years. Early historical and genealogical records note the existence of major groups such as the Cruthin, Corcu Loígde, Dál Riata, Dáirine, Deirgtine, Delbhna, Érainn, Laigin, Ulaid. Later major groups included the Connachta, Ciannachta, Eóganachta. Smaller groups included the aithechthúatha (see Attacotti), Cálraighe, Cíarraige, Conmaicne, Dartraighe, Déisi, Éile, Fir Bolg, Fortuatha, Gailenga, Gamanraige, Mairtine, Múscraige, Partraige, Soghain, Uaithni, Uí Maine, Uí Liatháin. Many survived into late medieval times, others vanished as they became politically unimportant. Over the past 1,200 years, Vikings, Normans, Welsh, Flemings, Scots, English, Africans and Eastern Europeans have all added to the population and have had significant influences on Irish culture.\\nThe population of Ireland rose rapidly from the 16th century until the mid-19th century, interrupted briefly by the Famine of 1740–41, which killed roughly two-fifths of the island\\'s population. The population rebounded and multiplied over the next century, but the Great Famine of the 1840s caused one million deaths and forced over one million more to emigrate in its immediate wake. Over the following century, the population was reduced by over half, at a time when the general trend in European countries was for populations to rise by an average of three-fold.\\nIreland\\'s largest religious group is Christianity. The largest denomination is Roman Catholicism, representing over 73% of the island (and about 87% of the Republic of Ireland). Most of the rest of the population adhere to one of the various Protestant denominations (about 48% of Northern Ireland). The largest is the Anglican Church of Ireland. The Muslim community is growing in Ireland, mostly through increased immigration, with a 50% increase in the republic between the 2006 and 2011 census. The island has a small Jewish community. About 4% of the Republic\\'s population and about 14% of the Northern Ireland population describe themselves as of no religion. In a 2010 survey conducted on behalf of the Irish Times, 32% of respondents said they went to a religious service more than once per week.\\n\\n\\n=== Divisions and settlements ===\\n\\nTraditionally, Ireland is subdivided into four provinces: Connacht (west), Leinster (east), Munster (south), and Ulster (north). In a system that developed between the 13th and 17th centuries, Ireland has 32 traditional counties. Twenty-six of these counties are in the Republic of Ireland, and six are in Northern Ireland. The six counties that constitute Northern Ireland are all in the province of Ulster (which has nine counties in total). As such, Ulster is often used as a synonym for Northern Ireland, although the two are not coterminous. In the Republic of Ireland, counties form the basis of the system of local government. Counties Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford and Tipperary have been broken up into smaller administrative areas. However, they are still treated as counties for cultural and some official purposes, for example, postal addresses and by the Ordnance Survey Ireland. Counties in Northern Ireland are no longer used for local governmental purposes, but, as in the Republic, their traditional boundaries are still used for informal purposes such as sports leagues and in cultural or tourism contexts.City status in Ireland is decided by legislative or royal charter. Dublin, with over one million residents in the Greater Dublin Area, is the largest city on the island. Belfast, with 579,726 residents, is the largest city in Northern Ireland. City status does not directly equate with population size. For example, Armagh, with 14,590 is the seat of the Church of Ireland and the Roman Catholic Primate of All Ireland and was re-granted city status by Queen Elizabeth II in 1994 (having lost that status in local government reforms of 1840). In the Republic of Ireland, Kilkenny, the seat of the Butler dynasty, while no longer a city for administrative purposes (since the 2001 Local Government Act), is entitled by law to continue to use the description.\\n\\n\\n=== Migration ===\\nThe population of Ireland collapsed dramatically during the second half of the 19th century. A population of over eight million in 1841 was reduced to slightly over four million by 1921. In part, the fall in population was caused by death from the Great Famine of 1845 to 1852, which took roughly one million lives. The remaining decline of around three million was due to the entrenched culture of emigration caused by the dire economic state of the country, lasting until the late 20th century.\\nEmigration from Ireland in the 19th century contributed to the populations of England, the United States, Canada and Australia, in all of which a large Irish diaspora lives. As of 2006, 4.3 million Canadians, or 14% of the population, were of Irish descent, while around one-third of the Australian population had an element of Irish descent. As of 2013, there were 40 million Irish-Americans and 33 million Americans who claimed Irish ancestry.With growing prosperity since the last decade of the 20th century, Ireland became a destination for immigrants. Since the European Union expanded to include Poland in 2004, Polish people have comprised the largest number of immigrants (over 150,000) from Central Europe. There has also been significant immigration from Lithuania, Czech Republic and Latvia.The Republic of Ireland in particular has seen large-scale immigration, with 420,000 foreign nationals as of 2006, about 10% of the population. Nearly a quarter of births (24 percent) in 2009 were to mothers born outside of Ireland. Up to 50,000 eastern and central European migrant workers left Ireland in response to the Irish financial crisis.\\n\\n\\n=== Languages ===\\n\\nThe two official languages of the Republic of Ireland are Irish and English. Each language has produced noteworthy literature. Irish, though now only the language of a minority, was the vernacular of the Irish people for thousands of years and was possibly introduced during the Iron Age. It began to be written down after Christianisation in the 5th century and spread to Scotland and the Isle of Man, where it evolved into the Scottish Gaelic and Manx languages respectively.\\nThe Irish language has a vast treasury of written texts from many centuries and is divided by linguists into Old Irish from the 6th to 10th century, Middle Irish from the 10th to 13th century, Early Modern Irish until the 17th century, and the Modern Irish spoken today. It remained the dominant language of Ireland for most of those periods, having influences from Latin, Old Norse, French and English. It declined under British rule but remained the majority tongue until the early 19th century, and since then has been a minority language.\\nThe Gaelic Revival of the late 19th and early 20th centuries had a long-term influence. Irish is taught in mainstream Irish schools as a compulsory subject, but teaching methods have been criticised for their ineffectiveness, with most students showing little evidence of fluency even after fourteen years of instruction.There is now a growing population of urban Irish speakers in both the Republic and Northern Ireland, especially in Dublin and Belfast, with the children of such Irish speakers sometimes attending Irish-medium schools (Gaelscoil). It has been argued that they tend to be more highly educated than monolingual English speakers. Recent research suggests that urban Irish is developing in a direction of its own, both in pronunciation and grammar.Traditional rural Irish-speaking areas, known collectively as the Gaeltacht, are in linguistic decline. The main Gaeltacht areas are in the west, south-west and north-west, in Galway, Mayo, Donegal, western Cork and Kerry with smaller Gaeltacht areas near Dungarvan in Waterford and in Meath.English in Ireland was first introduced during the Norman invasion. It was spoken by a few peasants and merchants brought over from England and was largely replaced by Irish before the Tudor conquest of Ireland. It was introduced as the official language during the Tudor and Cromwellian conquests. The Ulster plantations gave it a permanent foothold in Ulster, and it remained the official and upper-class language elsewhere, the Irish-speaking chieftains and nobility having been deposed. Language shift during the 19th century replaced Irish with English as the first language for a vast majority of the population.Fewer than 2% of the population of the Republic of Ireland today speak Irish on a daily basis, and under 10% regularly, outside of the education system and 38% of those over 15 years are classified as \"Irish speakers\". In Northern Ireland, English is the de facto official language, but official recognition is afforded to Irish, including specific protective measures under Part III of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. A lesser status (including recognition under Part II of the Charter) is given to Ulster Scots dialects, which are spoken by roughly 2% of Northern Ireland residents, and also spoken by some in the Republic of Ireland. Since the 1960s with the increase in immigration, many more languages have been introduced, particularly deriving from Asia and Eastern Europe.\\nAlso native to Ireland are Shelta, the language of the nomadic Irish Travellers, Irish Sign Language, and Northern Ireland Sign Language.\\n\\n\\n== Culture ==\\n\\nIreland\\'s culture comprises elements of the culture of ancient peoples, later immigrant and broadcast cultural influences (chiefly Gaelic culture, Anglicisation, Americanisation and aspects of broader European culture). In broad terms, Ireland is regarded as one of the Celtic nations of Europe, alongside Scotland, Wales, Cornwall, Isle of Man and Brittany. This combination of cultural influences is visible in the intricate designs termed Irish interlace or Celtic knotwork. These can be seen in the ornamentation of medieval religious and secular works. The style is still popular today in jewellery and graphic art, as is the distinctive style of traditional Irish music and dance, and has become indicative of modern \"Celtic\" culture in general.\\nReligion has played a significant role in the cultural life of the island since ancient times (and since the 17th century plantations, has been the focus of political identity and divisions on the island). Ireland\\'s pre-Christian heritage fused with the Celtic Church following the missions of Saint Patrick in the fifth century. The Hiberno-Scottish missions, begun by the Irish monk Saint Columba, spread the Irish vision of Christianity to pagan England and the Frankish Empire. These missions brought written language to an illiterate population of Europe during the Dark Ages that followed the fall of Rome, earning Ireland the sobriquet, \"the island of saints and scholars\".\\nSince the 20th century Irish pubs worldwide have become outposts of Irish culture, especially those with a full range of cultural and gastronomic offerings.\\n\\n\\n=== Arts ===\\n\\n\\n==== Literature ====\\n\\nIreland has made a substantial contribution to world literature in all its branches, both in Irish and English. Poetry in Irish is among the oldest vernacular poetry in Europe, with the earliest examples dating from the 6th century.\\nIrish remained the dominant literary language down to the nineteenth century, despite the spread of English from the seventeenth century on. Prominent names from the medieval period and later include Gofraidh Fionn Ó Dálaigh (fourteenth century), Dáibhí Ó Bruadair (seventeenth century) and Aogán Ó Rathaille (eighteenth century). Eibhlín Dubh Ní Chonaill (c.\\u20091743 – c.\\u20091800) was an outstanding poet in the oral tradition. The latter part of the nineteenth century saw a rapid replacement of Irish by English. By 1900, however, cultural nationalists had begun the Gaelic revival, which saw the beginnings of modern literature in Irish. This was to produce a number of notable writers, including Máirtín Ó Cadhain, Máire Mhac an tSaoi and others. Irish-language publishers such as Coiscéim and Cló Iar-Chonnacht continue to produce scores of titles every year.\\nIn English, Jonathan Swift, often called the foremost satirist in the English language, gained fame for works such as Gulliver\\'s Travels and A Modest Proposal. Other notable 18th-century writers of Irish origin included Oliver Goldsmith and Richard Brinsley Sheridan, though they spent most of their lives in England. The Anglo-Irish novel came to the fore in the nineteenth century, featuring such writers as Charles Kickham, William Carleton, and (in collaboration) Edith Somerville and Violet Florence Martin. The playwright and poet Oscar Wilde, noted for his epigrams, was born in Ireland.\\nIn the 20th century, Ireland produced four winners of the Nobel Prize for Literature: George Bernard Shaw, William Butler Yeats, Samuel Beckett and Seamus Heaney. Although not a Nobel Prize winner, James Joyce is widely considered to be one of the most significant writers of the 20th century. Joyce\\'s 1922 novel Ulysses is considered one of the most important works of Modernist literature and his life is celebrated annually on 16 June in Dublin as \"Bloomsday\". A comparable writer in Irish is Máirtín Ó Cadhain, whose 1949 novel Cré na Cille is regarded as a modernist masterpiece and has been translated into several languages.\\nModern Irish literature is often connected with its rural heritage through English-language writers such as John McGahern and Seamus Heaney and Irish-language writers such as Máirtín Ó Direáin and others from the Gaeltacht.\\n\\n\\n==== Music and dance ====\\n\\nMusic has been in evidence in Ireland since prehistoric times. Although in the early Middle Ages the church was \"quite unlike its counterpart in continental Europe\", there was a considerable interchange between monastic settlements in Ireland and the rest of Europe that contributed to what is known as Gregorian chant. Outside religious establishments, musical genres in early Gaelic Ireland are referred to as a triad of weeping music (goltraige), laughing music (geantraige) and sleeping music (suantraige). Vocal and instrumental music (e.g. for the harp, pipes, and various string instruments) was transmitted orally, but the Irish harp, in particular, was of such significance that it became Ireland\\'s national symbol. Classical music following European models first developed in urban areas, in establishments of Anglo-Irish rule such as Dublin Castle, St Patrick\\'s Cathedral and Christ Church as well as the country houses of the Anglo-Irish ascendancy, with the first performance of Handel\\'s Messiah (1742) being among the highlights of the baroque era. In the 19th century, public concerts provided access to classical music to all classes of society. Yet, for political and financial reasons Ireland has been too small to provide a living to many musicians, so the names of the better-known Irish composers of this time belong to emigrants.\\nIrish traditional music and dance have seen a surge in popularity and global coverage since the 1960s. In the middle years of the 20th century, as Irish society was modernising, traditional music had fallen out of favour, especially in urban areas. However during the 1960s, there was a revival of interest in Irish traditional music led by groups such as the Dubliners, the Chieftains, the Wolfe Tones, the Clancy Brothers, Sweeney\\'s Men and individuals like Seán Ó Riada and Christy Moore. Groups and musicians including Horslips, Van Morrison and Thin Lizzy incorporated elements of Irish traditional music into contemporary rock music and, during the 1970s and 1980s, the distinction between traditional and rock musicians became blurred, with many individuals regularly crossing over between these styles of playing. This trend can be seen more recently in the work of artists like Enya, the Saw Doctors, the Corrs, Sinéad O\\'Connor, Clannad, the Cranberries and the Pogues among others.\\n\\n\\n==== Art ====\\n\\nThe earliest known Irish graphic art and sculpture are Neolithic carvings found at sites such as Newgrange and is traced through Bronze Age artefacts and the religious carvings and illuminated manuscripts of the medieval period. During the course of the 19th and 20th centuries, a strong tradition of painting emerged, including such figures as John Butler Yeats, William Orpen, Jack Yeats and Louis le Brocquy. Contemporary Irish visual artists of note include Sean Scully, Kevin Abosch, and Alice Maher.\\n\\n\\n==== Drama and theatre ====\\n\\nThe Republic of Ireland\\'s national theatre is the Abbey Theatre, which was founded in 1904, and the national Irish-language theatre is An Taibhdhearc, which was established in 1928 in Galway. Playwrights such as Seán O\\'Casey, Brian Friel, Sebastian Barry, Conor McPherson and Billy Roche are internationally renowned.\\n\\n\\n=== Science ===\\nThe Irish philosopher and theologian Johannes Scotus Eriugena was considered one of the leading intellectuals of the early Middle Ages. Sir Ernest Henry Shackleton, an Irish explorer, was one of the principal figures of Antarctic exploration. He, along with his expedition, made the first ascent of Mount Erebus and the discovery of the approximate location of the South Magnetic Pole. Robert Boyle was a 17th-century natural philosopher, chemist, physicist, inventor and early gentleman scientist. He is largely regarded as one of the founders of modern chemistry and is best known for the formulation of Boyle\\'s law.19th-century physicist, John Tyndall, discovered the Tyndall effect. Father Nicholas Joseph Callan, professor of natural philosophy in Maynooth College, is best known for his invention of the induction coil, transformer and he discovered an early method of galvanisation in the 19th century.\\nOther notable Irish physicists include Ernest Walton, winner of the 1951 Nobel Prize in Physics. With Sir John Douglas Cockcroft, he was the first to split the nucleus of the atom by artificial means and made contributions to the development of a new theory of wave equation. William Thomson, or Lord Kelvin, is the person whom the absolute temperature unit, the kelvin, is named after. Sir Joseph Larmor, a physicist and mathematician, made innovations in the understanding of electricity, dynamics, thermodynamics and the electron theory of matter. His most influential work was Aether and Matter, a book on theoretical physics published in 1900.George Johnstone Stoney introduced the term electron in 1891. John Stewart Bell was the originator of Bell\\'s Theorem and a paper concerning the discovery of the Bell-Jackiw-Adler anomaly and was nominated for a Nobel prize. The astronomer Jocelyn Bell Burnell, from Lurgan, County Armagh, discovered pulsars in 1967. Notable mathematicians include Sir William Rowan Hamilton, famous for work in classical mechanics and the invention of quaternions. Francis Ysidro Edgeworth\\'s contribution, the Edgeworth Box. remains influential in neo-classical microeconomic theory to this day; while Richard Cantillon inspired Adam Smith, among others. John B. Cosgrave was a specialist in number theory and discovered a 2000-digit prime number in 1999 and a record composite Fermat number in 2003. John Lighton Synge made progress in different fields of science, including mechanics and geometrical methods in general relativity. He had mathematician John Nash as one of his students. Kathleen Lonsdale, born in Ireland and most known for her work with crystallography, became the first female president of the British Association for the Advancement of Science.Ireland has nine universities, seven in the Republic of Ireland and two in Northern Ireland, including Trinity College Dublin and the University College Dublin, as well as numerous third-level colleges and institutes and a branch of the Open University, the Open University in Ireland. Ireland was ranked 22nd in the Global Innovation Index in 2023, down from 12th in 2019.\\n\\n\\n=== Sports ===\\n\\nGaelic football is the most popular sport in Ireland in terms of match attendance and community involvement, with about 2,600 clubs on the island. In 2003 it represented 34% of total sports attendances at events in Ireland and abroad, followed by hurling at 23%, soccer at 16% and rugby at 8%. The All-Ireland Football Final is the most watched event in the sporting calendar. Soccer is the most widely played team game on the island and the most popular in Northern Ireland.Other sporting activities with the highest levels of playing participation include swimming, golf, aerobics, cycling, and billiards/snooker. Many other sports are also played and followed, including boxing, cricket, fishing, greyhound racing, handball, hockey, horse racing, motor sport, show jumping and tennis.\\nThe island fields a single international team in most sports. One notable exception to this is association football, although both associations continued to field international teams under the name \"Ireland\" until the 1950s. The sport is also the most notable exception where the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland field separate international teams. Northern Ireland has produced two World Snooker Champions.\\n\\n\\n==== Field sports ====\\n\\nGaelic football, hurling and Gaelic handball are the best-known Irish traditional sports, collectively known as Gaelic games. Gaelic games are governed by the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA), with the exception of women\\'s Gaelic football and camogie (women\\'s variant of hurling), which are governed by separate organisations. The headquarters of the GAA (and the main stadium) is located at  Croke Park in north Dublin and has a capacity of 82,500. Many major GAA games are played there, including the semi-finals and finals of the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship and All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship. During the redevelopment of the Lansdowne Road stadium in 2007–2010, international rugby and soccer were played there. All GAA players, even at the highest level, are amateurs, receiving no wages, although they are permitted to receive a limited amount of sport-related income from commercial sponsorship.\\nThe Irish Football Association (IFA) was originally the governing body for soccer across the island. The game has been played in an organised fashion in Ireland since the 1870s, with Cliftonville F.C. in Belfast being Ireland\\'s oldest club. It was most popular, especially in its first decades, around Belfast and in Ulster. However, some clubs based outside Belfast thought that the IFA largely favoured Ulster-based clubs in such matters as selection for the national team. In 1921, following an incident in which, despite an earlier promise, the IFA moved an Irish Cup semi-final replay from Dublin to Belfast, Dublin-based clubs broke away to form the Football Association of the Irish Free State. Today the southern association is known as the Football Association of Ireland (FAI). Despite being initially blacklisted by the Home Nations\\' associations, the FAI was recognised by FIFA in 1923 and organised its first international fixture in 1926 (against Italy). However, both the IFA and FAI continued to select their teams from the whole of Ireland, with some players earning international caps for matches with both teams. Both also referred to their respective teams as Ireland.\\n\\nIn 1950, FIFA directed the associations only to select players from within their respective territories and, in 1953, directed that the FAI\\'s team be known only as \"Republic of Ireland\" and that the IFA\\'s team be known as \"Northern Ireland\" (with certain exceptions). Northern Ireland qualified for the World Cup finals in 1958 (reaching the quarter-finals), 1982 and 1986 and the European Championship in 2016. The Republic qualified for the World Cup finals in 1990 (reaching the quarter-finals), 1994, 2002 and the European Championship in 1988, 2012 and 2016. Across Ireland, there is significant interest in the English and, to a lesser extent, Scottish soccer leagues.\\nIreland fields a single national rugby team and a single association, the Irish Rugby Football Union, governs the sport across the island. The Irish rugby team have played in every Rugby World Cup, making the quarter-finals in six of them. Ireland also hosted games during the 1991 and the 1999 Rugby World Cups (including a quarter-final). There are four professional Irish teams; all four play in the Pro14 and at least three compete for the Heineken Cup. Irish rugby has become increasingly competitive at both the international and provincial levels since the sport went professional in 1994. During that time, Ulster (1999), Munster (2006 and 2008) and Leinster (2009, 2011 and 2012) have won the Heineken Cup. In addition to this, the Irish International side has had increased success in the Six Nations Championship against the other European elite sides. This success, including Triple Crowns in 2004, 2006 and 2007, culminated with a clean sweep of victories, known as a Grand Slam, in 2009 and 2018.\\n\\n\\n==== Boxing ====\\n\\nAmateur boxing on the island of Ireland is governed by the Irish Athletic Boxing Association. Ireland has won more medals in boxing than in any other Olympic sport. Michael Carruth won a gold medal and Wayne McCullough won a silver medal in the Barcelona Olympic Games. In 2008 Kenneth Egan won a silver medal in the Beijing Games. Paddy Barnes secured bronze in those games and gold in the 2010 European Amateur Boxing Championships (where Ireland came 2nd in the overall medal table) and 2010 Commonwealth Games. Katie Taylor has won gold in every European and World championship since 2005. In August 2012 at the Olympic Games in London, Taylor created history by becoming the first Irish woman to win a gold medal in boxing in the 60 kg lightweight. More recently, Kellie Harrington won a gold medal at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.\\n\\n\\n==== Other sports ====\\n\\nHorse racing and greyhound racing are both popular in Ireland. There are frequent horse race meetings and greyhound stadiums are well-attended. The island is noted for the breeding and training of race horses and is also a large exporter of racing dogs. The horse racing sector is largely concentrated in the County Kildare.Irish athletics is an all-Ireland sport governed by Athletics Ireland. Sonia O\\'Sullivan won two medals at 5,000 metres on the track; gold at the 1995 World Championships and silver at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Gillian O\\'Sullivan won silver in the 20k walk at the 2003 World Championships, while sprint hurdler Derval O\\'Rourke won gold at the 2006 World Indoor Championship in Moscow. Olive Loughnane won a silver medal in the 20k walk at the World Athletics Championships in Berlin in 2009.Golf is very popular, and golf tourism is a major industry attracting more than 240,000 golfing visitors annually. The 2006 Ryder Cup was held at The K Club in County Kildare. Pádraig Harrington became the first Irishman since Fred Daly in 1947 to win the British Open at Carnoustie in July 2007. He successfully defended his title in July 2008 before going on to win the PGA Championship in August. Harrington became the first European to win the PGA Championship in 78 years and was the first winner from Ireland. Three golfers from Northern Ireland have been particularly successful. In 2010, Graeme McDowell became the first Irish golfer to win the U.S. Open, and the first European to win that tournament since 1970. Rory McIlroy, at the age of 22, won the 2011 U.S. Open, while Darren Clarke\\'s latest victory was the 2011 Open Championship at Royal St. George\\'s. In August 2012, McIlroy won his 2nd major championship by winning the USPGA Championship by a record margin of 8 shots.\\n\\n\\n==== Recreation ====\\nThe west coast of Ireland, Lahinch and Donegal Bay in particular, have popular surfing beaches, being fully exposed to the Atlantic Ocean. Donegal Bay is shaped like a funnel and catches west/south-west Atlantic winds, creating good surf, especially in winter. Since just before the year 2010, Bundoran has hosted European championship surfing. Scuba diving is increasingly popular in Ireland with clear waters and large populations of sea life, particularly along the western seaboard. There are also many shipwrecks along the coast of Ireland, with some of the best wreck dives being in Malin Head and off the County Cork coast.With thousands of lakes, over 14,000 kilometres (8,700 mi) of fish-bearing rivers and over 7,500 kilometres (4,660 mi) of coastline, Ireland is a popular angling destination. The temperate Irish climate is suited to sport angling. While salmon and trout fishing remain popular with anglers, salmon fishing, in particular, received a boost in 2006 with the closing of the salmon driftnet fishery. Coarse fishing continues to increase its profile. Sea angling is developed with many beaches mapped and signposted, and the range of sea angling species is around 80.\\n\\n\\n=== Food and drink ===\\n\\nFood and cuisine in Ireland take their influence from the crops grown and animals farmed in the island\\'s temperate climate and from the social and political circumstances of Irish history. For example, whilst from the Middle Ages until the arrival of the potato in the 16th century the dominant feature of the Irish economy was the herding of cattle, the number of cattle a person owned was equated to their social standing. Thus herders would avoid slaughtering a milk-producing cow.For this reason, pork and white meat were more common than beef, and thick fatty strips of salted bacon (known as rashers) and the eating of salted butter (i.e. a dairy product rather than beef itself) have been a central feature of the diet in Ireland since the Middle Ages. The practice of bleeding cattle and mixing the blood with milk and butter (not unlike the practice of the Maasai) was common and black pudding, made from blood, grain (usually barley) and seasoning, remains a breakfast staple in Ireland. All of these influences can be seen today in the phenomenon of the \"breakfast roll\".\\nThe introduction of the potato in the second half of the 16th century heavily influenced cuisine thereafter. Great poverty encouraged a subsistence approach to food, and by the mid-19th century, the vast majority of the population sufficed with a diet of potatoes and milk. A typical family, consisting of a man, a woman and four children, would eat 18 stone (110 kg) of potatoes per week. Consequently, dishes that are considered as national dishes represent a fundamental simplicity to cooking, such as the Irish stew, bacon and cabbage, boxty, a type of potato pancake, or colcannon, a dish of mashed potatoes and kale or cabbage.Since the last quarter of the 20th century, with a re-emergence of wealth in Ireland, a \"New Irish Cuisine\" based on traditional ingredients incorporating international influences has emerged. This cuisine is based on fresh vegetables, fish (especially salmon, trout, oysters, mussels and other shellfish), as well as traditional soda breads and the wide range of hand-made cheeses that are now being produced across the country. An example of this new cuisine is \"Dublin Lawyer\": lobster cooked in whiskey and cream. The potato remains however a fundamental feature of this cuisine and the Irish remain the highest per capita consumers of potatoes in Europe. Traditional regional foods can be found throughout the country, for example coddle in Dublin or drisheen in Cork, both a type of sausage, or blaa, a doughy white bread particular to Waterford.\\n\\nIreland once dominated the world\\'s market for whiskey, producing 90% of the world\\'s whiskey at the start of the 20th century. However, as a consequence of bootleggers during the prohibition in the United States (who sold poor-quality whiskey bearing Irish-sounding names thus eroding the pre-prohibition popularity for Irish brands) and tariffs on Irish whiskey across the British Empire during the Anglo-Irish Trade War of the 1930s, sales of Irish whiskey worldwide fell to a mere 2% by the mid-20th century. In 1953, an Irish government survey, found that 50% of whiskey drinkers in the United States had never heard of Irish whiskey.Irish whiskey, as researched in 2009 by the CNBC American broadcaster, remains popular domestically and has grown in international sales steadily over a few decades. Typically CNBC states Irish whiskey is not as smoky as a Scotch whisky, but not as sweet as American or Canadian whiskies. Whiskey forms the basis of cream liqueurs, such as Baileys, and the \"Irish coffee\" (a cocktail of coffee and whiskey reputedly invented at Foynes flying-boat station) is probably the best-known Irish cocktail.\\nStout, a kind of porter beer, particularly Guinness, is typically associated with Ireland, although historically it was more closely associated with London. Porter remains very popular, although it has lost sales since the mid-20th century to lager. Cider, particularly Magners (marketed in the Republic of Ireland as Bulmers), is also a popular drink. Red lemonade, a soft-drink, is consumed on its own and as a mixer, particularly with whiskey.\\n\\n\\n== Economy ==\\n\\n\\n=== Overview and GDP ===\\nThe GDP of the Republic of Ireland as of 2021 was €423.5 billion (nominal), and in Northern Ireland in 2021, it was £52 billion (GVA Balanced). The GDP per capita in the Republic of Ireland was €84,049.9 (nominal) as of 2021, and in Northern Ireland 2021 was £27,154 (GVA Balanced). The Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom measure these numbers differently.\\nDespite the two jurisdictions using two distinct currencies (the euro and pound sterling), a growing amount of commercial activity is carried out on an all-Ireland basis. This has been facilitated by the two jurisdictions\\' former shared membership of the European Union, and there have been calls from members of the business community and policymakers for the creation of an \"all-Ireland economy\" to take advantage of economies of scale and boost competitiveness.\\n\\n\\n==== Regional economics ====\\nBelow is a comparison of the regional GDP on the island of Ireland.\\n\\n\\n==== Northern Ireland trade comparison ====\\nBelow is a comparison of the goods being sold and purchased between Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom, compared with the goods being exported and imported between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland:\\n\\n\\n==== Cost of living comparison ====\\nBelow is a comparison of the monthly cost of living and average wage after tax in Northern Ireland versus those in the Republic of Ireland in 2023:\\n\\n\\n=== Economic history ===\\n\\nPrior to partition in 1921, Ireland had a long history as an economic colony – first, partially, of the Norse, via their cities (9th to 10th centuries CE), and later, to varying extents, of polities related to England. Though the climate and soil favoured certain forms of agriculture, trade barriers frequently hobbled its development. Repeated invasions and plantations disrupted land-ownership, and multiple failed uprisings also contributed to repeated phases of deportation and of emigration.\\nSalient events in the economic history of Ireland include:\\n\\n16th and 17th centuries: confiscation and redistribution of land in the Plantations of Ireland\\n1845–1849: The Great Famine occasioned depopulation and mass emigration\\n1846: Westminster\\'s repeal of the Corn Laws disrupted Irish agriculture\\n\\n\\n=== Major industries ===\\n\\n\\n==== Tourism ====\\n\\nThere are three World Heritage Sites on the island: the Brú na Bóinne complex, Skellig Michael and the Giant\\'s Causeway. Several other places are on the tentative list, for example the Burren, the Ceide Fields and Mount Stewart.Some of the most visited sites in Ireland include Bunratty Castle, the Rock of Cashel, the Cliffs of Moher, Holy Cross Abbey and Blarney Castle. Historically important monastic sites include Glendalough and Clonmacnoise, which are maintained as national monuments in the Republic of Ireland.The Dublin region receives the most tourists and is home to several of the most popular attractions such as the Guinness Storehouse and Book of Kells. The west and south west, which includes the Lakes of Killarney and the Dingle peninsula in County Kerry and Connemara and the Aran Islands in County Galway, are also popular tourist destinations.Achill Island lies off the coast of County Mayo and is Ireland\\'s largest island. It is a popular tourist destination for surfing and contains 5 Blue Flag beaches and Croaghaun one of the world\\'s highest sea cliffs. Stately homes, built during the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries in Palladian, Neoclassical and neo-Gothic styles, such as Castle Ward, Castletown House, Bantry House, Strokestown Park and Glenveagh Castle are also of interest to tourists. Some have been converted into hotels, such as Ashford Castle, Castle Leslie and Dromoland Castle.\\n\\n\\n==== Energy ====\\n\\nAlthough for most of their existence electricity networks in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland were entirely separate, the island has operated for some time as a single market for electricity. Both networks were designed and constructed independently post-partition but they are now connected with three interlinks and are also connected through Great Britain to mainland Europe. The situation in Northern Ireland is complicated by the issue of private companies not supplying Northern Ireland Electricity with enough power. In the Republic of Ireland, the ESB has failed to modernise its power stations, and the availability of power plants has recently averaged only 66%, one of the worst such rates in Western Europe. EirGrid has started building a HVDC transmission line between Ireland and Great Britain with a capacity of 500 MW, about 10% of Ireland\\'s peak demand.\\nAs with electricity, the natural gas distribution network is also now all-island, with a pipeline linking Gormanston, County Meath, and Ballyclare, County Antrim. Most of Ireland\\'s gas comes through interconnectors between Twynholm in Scotland and Ballylumford, County Antrim and Loughshinny, County Dublin. Supplies come from the Corrib Gas Field, off the coast of County Mayo, with a supply previously also coming from the Kinsale gas field off the County Cork coast. The County Mayo field faces some localised opposition over a controversial decision to refine the gas onshore.\\n\\nIreland has an ancient industry based on peat (known locally as \"turf\") as a source of energy for home fires. A form of biomass energy, this source of heat is still widely used in rural areas. However, because of the ecological importance of peatlands in storing carbon and their rarity, the EU is attempting to protect this habitat by fining Ireland for digging up peat. In cities, heat is generally supplied by natural gas or heating oil, although some urban suppliers distribute sods of turf as \"smokeless fuel\" for domestic use.\\nThe Republic has a strong commitment to renewable energy and ranks as one of the top 10 markets for clean-technology investment in the 2014 Global Green Economy Index. Research and development in renewable energy (such as wind power) has increased since 2004. Large wind farms have been constructed in Cork, Donegal, Mayo and Antrim. The construction of wind farms has in some cases been delayed by opposition from local communities, some of whom regard the wind turbines as unsightly. The Republic is hindered by an ageing network that was not designed to handle the varying availability of power that comes from wind farms. The ESB\\'s Turlough Hill facility is the only power-storage facility in the state.\\n\\n\\n== Explanatory notes ==\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Bibliography ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\n Wikimedia Atlas of Ireland\\nGovernment of Ireland\\nNorthern Ireland Executive', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n')]"

BUSINESS\\nOverview\\nAs our founders Larry and Sergey wrote in the original founders\\' letter, \"Google is not a conventional company. \\nWe do not intend to become one.\" That unconventional spirit has been  a driving force throughout our history, inspiring \\nus to tackle big problems and invest in moonshots, such as our long-term opportuniti es in artificial intelligence (AI). We \\ncontinue this work under the leadership of Alphabet and Google CEO  Sundar Pichai.\\nAlphabet is a collection of businesses — the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments, \\nGoogle Services and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. Alphabet\\'s \\nstructure is about helping each of our businesses prosper through strong leaders and independence. \\nAccess and technology for everyone\\nThe Internet is one of the world’s most powerful equalizers; it propels ideas, people and businesses large and \\nsmall. Our mission to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful is as relevant \\ntoday as it was when we were founded in 1998. Since then, we have evolved from a company that helps people find \\nanswers to a company that also helps people get things done. \\nWe are focused on building an even more helpful Google  for everyone , and we aspire to give everyone the tools \\nthey need to increase their knowledge, health, happiness, and success. Google Search helps people find information \\nand make sense of the world in more natural and intuitive ways, with trillions of searches on Google every year. \\nYouTube provides people with entertainment, information, and opportunities to learn something new. Google Assistant \\noffers the best way to get things done seamlessly across different devices, providing intelligent help throughout a \\nperson\\'s day, no matter where they are. Google Cloud helps customers solve today’s business challenges, improve \\nproductivity, reduce costs, and unlock new growth engines.  We are continually innovating and building new products \\nand features that will help our users, partners, customers, and communities and have invested more than $100 billion  \\nin research and development in the last five years in support of these efforts.Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n4', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

This \\nincrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not \\nevolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acqu ired YouTube and Android and when we launched Chrome, \\nbut those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices and a safer, popular browser. \\nWe continue to look toward the future and to invest for the long term within each of our segments. As we said in the \\noriginal founders' letter, we will not shy away from high-risk,  high-reward projects that we believe in, as they are the \\nkey to our long-term success.\\nThe power of AI\\nWe believe that AI is a foundational and transformational technology that will provide compelling and helpful \\nbenefits to people and society through its capacity to assist, complement, empower, and inspire people in almost every \\nfield of human endeavor. As an information and computer science company , we will continue to be at the forefront of \\nadvancing the frontier of AI. Through our path-breaking and field-defining  research and development, we responsibly \\nand boldly develop more capable and useful AI every day. \\nAI already powers Google’s core products that help billions of people every day and has been at the foundation of \\nour core ads quality systems for years, helping large and small businesses all over the world to produce and run \\neffective and efficient ad campaigns that help grow their businesses. AI makes it possible to search in new languages, \\nwith multiple inputs, such as using images and text at the same time with the Google App. Some of our most popular \\nproducts at Google — including Lens and Translate — were built entirely using artificial intelligence technologies such \\nas optical character recognition and machine learning. Google Cloud continues to build AI into numerous solutions that \\nour customers can use to develop AI-powered applications — including processing documents, images, and translation \\n— to understand and analyze data more efficiently, and to use packaged solutions for a variety of industries.  In all \\nthese examples, AI significantly enhances the usefulness and multiplies the value of these products and services to \\npeople and organizations.\\nOur view  is that AI is now, and more than ever,  critical to delivering on our mission. As we bring our breakthrough \\nAI innovations into the real world to assist people and benefit society everywhere, we are also pursuing further \\nadvancements that will help to unlock scientific discoveries and to tackle humanity's greatest challenges and \\nopportunities.\\nPrivacy and security\\nWe make it a priority to protect the privacy and security of our products, users, and customers, even if there are \\nnear-term financial consequences. We do this by continuously investing in building products that are secure by default; \\nstrictly upholding responsible data practices that emphasize privacy by design; and building easy-to-use settings  that \\nput people in control.  We are continually enhancing these efforts over time, whether by enabling users to auto-delete \\ntheir data, giving them new tools, such as My Ad Center, to control their ad experience, or advancing anti-malware, \\nanti-phishing, and password security features.\\nGoogle\\nFor reporting purposes Google comprises two segments: Google Services and Google Cloud.\\nGoogle Services\\nServing our users\\nWe have always been committed to building helpful products that can improve the lives of millions  of people \\nworldwide. Our product innovations are what make o ur services widely used, and our brand one of the most \\nrecognized in the world. Google Services' core products and platforms include ads, Android, Chrome, hardware , \\nGmail, Google Drive, Google Maps, Google Photos, Google Play, Search, and YouTube, with broad and growing \\nadoption  by users around the world.\\nOur products and services have come a long way since the company was founded more than two decades ago. \\nRather than the ten blue links in our early search results, users can now get direct answers to their questions using \\ntheir computer or mobile device,  their  own voice , a photo, or an image , making it quicker, easier, and more natural to \\nfind what they are looking for. Of the searches we see every da y, 15% are new.\\nThis drive to make information more accessible and helpful has led us over the years to improve the discovery \\nand creation of digital content both on the web and through platforms like Google Play and YouTube.

The net proceeds from the issuance were used to fund environmentally \\nand socially responsible projects in the following eight areas: energy efficiency, clean energy, green buildings, \\nclean transportation, circular economy and design, affordable housing, commitment to racial equity, and \\nsupport for small businesses and COVID-19 crisis response.

Changes to our advertising policies and data privacy practices, as well \\nas changes to other companies’ advertising and/or data privacy practices have in the past, and may in the future, affect \\nthe advertising that we are able to provide. In addition, technologies have been developed that make customized ads \\nmore difficult or that block the display of ads altogether, and some providers of online services have integrated these \\ntechnologies that could potentially impair the availability and functionality of third-party digital advertising. Failing to \\nprovide superior value or deliver advertisements effectively and competitively could harm our business, reputation, \\nfinancial condition, and operating results. \\nIn addition, expenditures by advertisers tend to correlate with overall economic conditions. Adverse \\nmacroeconomic conditions have affected, and may in the future affect, the demand for advertising, resulting in \\nfluctuations in the amounts our advertisers spend on advertising, which could harm our financial condition and \\noperating results. \\nWe face intense competition. If we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that \\nare useful to users, customers, and other partners, we may not remain competitive, which could harm our \\nbusiness, financial condition, and operating results. \\nOur business environment is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive. Our businesses face changing \\ntechnologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of rival products and services. To compete successfully, \\nwe must accurately anticipate technology developments and deliver innovative, relevant and useful products, services, \\nand technologies in a timely manner. As our businesses evolve, the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass a \\nwider range of products and services. We must continue to invest significant resources in R&D, including through \\nacquisitions, in order to enhance our technology and new and existing products and services. \\nWe have many competitors in different industries. Our current and potential domestic and international \\ncompetitors range from large and established companies to emerging start-ups. Some competitors have longer \\noperating histories and well established relationships in various sectors. They can use their experience and resources \\nin ways that could affect our competitive position, including by making acquisitions, continuing to invest heavily in R&D \\nand in talent, initiating intellectual property and competition claims (whether or not meritorious), and continuing to \\ncompete for users, advertisers, customers, and content providers. Further, discrepancies in enforcement of existing \\nlaws may enable our lesser known competitors to aggressively interpret those laws without commensurate scrutiny, \\nthereby affording them competitive advantages. Our competitors may also be able to innovate and provide products \\nand services faster than we can or may foresee the need for products and services before us. \\nOur financial condition and operating results may also suffer if our products and services are not responsive to the \\nevolving needs and desires of our users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers. As new and \\nexisting technologies continue to develop, competitors and new entrants may be able to offer experiences that are, or \\nthat are seen to be, substantially similar to or better than ours. These technologies could reduce usage of our products \\nand services, and force us to compete in different ways and expend significant resources to develop and operate equal \\nor better products and services. Competitors’ success in providing compelling products and services or in attracting \\nand retaining users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers could harm our financial condition and \\noperating results. \\nOur ongoing investment in new businesses, products, services, and technologies is inherently risky, and \\ncould divert management attention and harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. \\nWe have invested and expect to continue to invest in new businesses, products, services, and technologies. The \\ninvestments that we are making across our businesses, such as in AI, reflect our ongoing efforts to innovate and \\nprovide products and services that are useful to users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers.

At the same time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services. Pricing and \\ndelivery models are competitive and constantly evolving, and we may not attain sufficient scale and profitability to \\nachieve our business objectives.

In particular, margins on our hardware pro ducts have \\nhad, and may continue to have, an adverse affect on our consolidated margins due to pressures on pricing and higher \\ncost of sales. We may also experience downward pressure on our operating margins from increasing regulations, \\nincreasing competition, and increasing costs for many aspects of our business.

If this happens, we could lose protection for this trademark, which could result in \\nother people using the word “Google” to refer to their own products, thus diminishing our brand. \\nAny significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability to compete. \\nAlso, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming.

We also rely on other companies to participate in the \\ndistribution of our products and services. Our business could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage these \\ncompanies with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms, or if those we engage fail to meet their \\nobligations (whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons), or make adverse changes in the pricing or other \\nmaterial terms of our arrangements with them. \\nWe have experienced and/or may in the future experience supply shortages, price increases, and/or longer lead \\ntimes that could negatively affect our operations, driven by raw material, component availability, manufacturing \\ncapacity, labor shortages, industry allocations, logistics capacity, inflation, foreign currency exchange rates, tariffs, \\nsanctions and export controls, trade disputes and barriers, geopolitical tensions, armed conflicts, natural disasters or \\npandemics, the effects of climate change (such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, heat waves, wildfires and resultant \\nair quality effects and power shutoffs associated with wildfire prevention, and increased storm severity), power loss, \\nand significant changes in the financial or business condition of our suppliers. In addition, some of the components we \\nuse in our technical infrastructure and our hardware products are available from only one or limited sources, and we \\nmay not be able to find replacement vendors on favorable terms in the event of a supply chain disruption. A significant \\nsupply interruption that affects us or our vendors could delay critical data center upgrades or expansions and delay \\nconsumer product availability. \\nWe may enter into long-term contracts for materials and products that commit us to significant terms and \\nconditions. We may face costs for materials and products that are not consumed due to market demand, technological \\nchange, changed consumer preferences, quality, product recalls, and warranty issues. For instance, because certain of \\nour hardware supply contracts have volume-based pricing or minimum purchase requirements, if the volume of our \\nhardware sales decreases or does not reach projected targets, we could face increased materials and manufacturing \\ncosts or other financial liabilities that could make our products more costly per unit to manufacture and harm our \\nfinancial condition and operating results. Furthermore, certain of our competitors may negotiate more favorable \\ncontractual terms based on volume and other commitments that may provide them with competitive advantages and \\nmay affect our supply. \\nOur products and services have had, and in the future may have, quality issues resulting from design, \\nmanufacturing, or operations.

Software bugs, theft, misuse, defects, vulnerabilities in our products and services, and security breaches \\nexpose us to a risk of loss or improper use and disclosure of such information, which could result in litigation and other \\npotential liabilities, including regulatory fines and penalties, as well as reputational harm. Additionally, our products \\nincorporate highly technical and complex technologies, and thus our technologies and software have contained, and \\nare likely in the future to contain, undetected errors, bugs, and/or vulnerabilities. We have in the past discovered, and \\nmay in the future discover, some errors in our software code only after we have released the code. Systems and \\ncontrol failures, security breaches, failure to comply with our privacy policies, and/or inadvertent disclosure of user data \\ncould result in government and legal exposure, seriously harm our reputation, brand, and business, and impair our \\nability to attract and retain users or customers. Such incidents have occurred in the past and may continue to occur \\ndue to the scale and nature of our products and services. While there is no guarantee that such incidents will not cause \\nsignificant damage, we expect to continue to expend significant resources to maintain security protections that limit the \\neffect of bugs, theft, misuse, and security vulnerabilities or breaches. \\nWe experience cyber attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems on a regular basis. \\nCyber attacks continue to evolve in sophistication and volume, and inherently may be difficult to detect for long periods \\nof time. We have seen, and will continue to see, industry-wide software supply chain vulnerabilities, such as the Log4j \\nvulnerability reported in December 2021, which could affect our or other parties’ systems. We expect to continue to \\nexperience such incidents or vulnerabilities in the future. Our efforts to address undesirable activity on our platform \\nmay also increase the risk of retaliatory attack. In addition, we face the risk of cyber attacks by nation-states and state-\\nsponsored actors. These attacks may target us or our customers, particularly our public sector customers (including \\nfederal, state, and local governments). Geopolitical tensions or armed conflicts, such as the ongoing conflict in \\nUkraine, may increase these risks. \\nWe may experience security issues, whether due to employee or insider error or malfeasance, system errors, or \\nvulnerabilities in our or other parties’ systems. While we may not determine some of these issues to be material at the \\ntime they occur and may remedy them quickly, there is no guarantee that these issues will not ultimately result in \\nsignificant legal, financial, and reputational harm, including government inquiries, enforcement actions, litigation, and \\nnegative publicity. There is also no guarantee that a series of issues may not be determined to be material at a later \\ndate in the aggregate, even if they may not be material individually at the time of their occurrence. Because the \\ntechniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, disable or degrade service provided by or otherwise sabotage \\nsystems change frequently and often are recognized only after being launched against a target, even taking all \\nreasonable precautions, including those required by law, we have been unable in the past and may continue to be \\nunable to anticipate or detect attacks or vulnerabilities or implement adequate preventative measures. \\nFurther, if any partners with whom we share user or other customer information fail to implement adequate data-\\nsecurity practices, fail to comply with our terms and policies, or otherwise suffer a network or other security breach, our \\nusers’ data may be improperly accessed, used, or disclosed. If an actual or perceived breach of our or our business \\npartners’ or service providers’ security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures \\nwould be harmed, we could lose users and customers, our trade secrets or those of our business partners may be \\ncompromised, and we may be exposed to significant legal and financial risks, including legal claims (which may \\ninclude class-action litigation) and regulatory actions, fines, and penalties. Any of the foregoing consequences could \\nharm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. \\nWhile we have dedicated significant resources to privacy and security incident response capabilities, including \\ndedicated worldwide incident response teams, our response process, particularly during times of a natural disaster or \\npandemic, may not be adequate, may fail to accurately assess the severity of an incident, may not be fast enough to \\nprevent or limit harm, or may fail to sufficiently remediate an incident. As a result, we may suffer significant legal, \\nreputational, or financial exposure, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

In \\naddition, in some jurisdictions, our products and services have been subject to government-initiated restrictions or \\nblockages. These could harm existing key relationships, including with our users, customers, advertisers, and/or \\ncontent providers, and impair our ability to attract new ones; harm our reputation; and increase costs, thereby \\nnegatively affecting our business. \\nRisks Related to Laws, Regulations, and Policies \\nWe are subject to a variety of new, existing, and changing laws and regulations worldwide that could \\nharm our business, and will likely be subject to an even broader scope of laws and regulations as we continue \\nto expand our business. \\nWe are subject to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subjects, and our \\nintroduction of new businesses, products, services, and technologies will likely continue to subject us to additional laws \\nand regulations. In recent years, governments around the world have proposed and adopted a large number of new \\nlaws and regulations relevant to the digital economy, particularly in the areas of data privacy and security, competition, \\nand online content. The costs of compliance with these measures are high and are likely to increase in the future. \\nNew or changing laws and regulations, or new interpretations or applications of existing laws and regulations in a \\nmanner inconsistent with our practices, have resulted in, and may continue to result in, less useful products and \\nservices, altered business practices, limited ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain products and \\nservices, substantial costs, and civil or criminal liability. Examples include laws and regulations regarding: \\n•Competition and technology platforms’ business practices: Laws and regulations focused on large \\ntechnology platforms, including the Digital Markets Act in the European Union (EU); regulations in South Korea \\nand elsewhere that affect Google Play’s billing policies, fees, and business model; as well as regulations under \\nconsideration in a range of jurisdictions.\\n•Data privacy, collection, and processing:  Laws and regulations further restricting the collection, processing, \\nand/or sharing of user or advertising-related data, including privacy and data protection laws, laws affecting the \\nprocessing of children's data (as discussed further below), data breach notification laws, and laws limiting data \\ntransfers (including data localization laws). \\n•Copyright and other intellectual property : Copyright and related laws, including the EU Directive on \\nCopyright in the Digital Single Market and European Economic Area transpositions, which may introduce new \\nlicensing regimes, increase liability with respect to content uploaded by users or linked to from our platforms, \\nor create property rights in news publications that could require payments to news agencies and publishers. \\n•Content  moderation : Various laws covering content moderation and removal, and related disclosure \\nobligations, such as the EU's Digital Services Act, Florida’s Senate Bill 7072 and Texas’ House Bill 20, and \\nlaws and proposed legislation in Singapore, Australia, and the United Kingdom that impose penalties for failure \\nto remove certain types of content or require disclosure of information about the operation of our services and \\nalgorithms, which may make it harder for services like Google Search and YouTube to detect and deal with \\nlow-quality, deceptive, or harmful content.\\n•Consumer  protection : Consumer protection laws, including the EU’s New Deal for Consumers, which could \\nresult in monetary penalties and create a range of new compliance obligations.\\nIn addition, the applicability and scope of these and other laws and regulations, as interpreted by the courts, \\nremain uncertain and could be interpreted in ways that harm our business. For example, we rely on statutory safe \\nharbors, like those set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and Section 230 of the Communications Decency \\nAct in the U.S. and the E-Commerce Directive in Europe, to protect against liability for various linking, caching, ranking, \\nrecommending, and hosting activities. Legislation or court rulings affecting these safe harbors may adversely affect us \\nand may impose significant operational challenges. There are legislative proposals and pending litigation in the U.S. \\n(such as Gonzalez  v. Google ), EU, and around the world that could diminish or eliminate safe harbor protection for \\nwebsites and online platforms. \\nWe are and may continue to be subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, \\nenforcement actions, consent orders, and other forms of regulatory scrutiny and legal liability that could harm \\nour business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The resolution of \\none or more such proceedings has resulted in, and may in the future result in, additional substantial fines, penalties, \\ninjunctions, and other sanctions that could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. \\nPrivacy, data protection, and data usage regulations are complex and rapidly evolving areas. Any failure \\nor alleged failure to comply with these laws could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and \\noperating results. \\nAuthorities around the world have adopted and are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals \\nconcerning data protection, data usage, and encryption of user data.

The validity of various data transfer mechanisms remains subject to legal, \\nregulatory, and political developments in both Europe and the U.S., including the potential adoption of the U.S.-EU \\nData Privacy Framework. Until the U.S.-EU Data Privacy Framework is adopted by the EU, the legal uncertainty and \\nongoing enforcement action from supervisory authorities related to cross-border transfers of personal data, could harm \\nour ability to process and transfer personal data outside of the European Economic Area and could in turn harm our \\nability to provide, and our customers’ ability to use, some of our products and services. \\nWe face, and may continue to face, intellectual property and other claims that could be costly to defend, \\nresult in significant damage awards or other costs (including indemnification awards), and limit our ability to \\nuse certain technologies. \\nWe, like other internet, technology, and media companies, are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations \\nof infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights, including patent, copyright, trade secrets, and \\ntrademarks. Parties have also sought broad injunctive relief against us by filing claims in U.S. and international courts \\nand the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) for exclusion and cease-and-desist orders. In addition, patent-\\nholding companies may frequently seek to generate income from patents they have obtained by bringing claims \\nagainst us. As we continue to expand our business, the number of intellectual property claims against us has increased \\nand may continue to increase as we develop and acquire new products, services, and technologies. \\nAdverse results in any of these lawsuits may include awards of monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing \\nagreements (if licenses are available at all), or orders limiting our ability to sell our products and services in the U.S. or \\nelsewhere, including by preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services in certain \\njurisdictions. They may also cause us to change our business practices in ways that could result in a loss of revenues \\nfor us and otherwise harm our business. \\nMany of our agreements with our customers and partners, including certain suppliers, require us to defend \\nagainst certain intellectual property infringement claims and in some cases indemnify them for certain intellectual \\nproperty infringement claims against them, which could result in increased costs for defending such claims or \\nsignificant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. Such customers and partners may also \\ndiscontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could \\nresult in loss of revenues and harm our business. Moreover, intellectual property indemnities provided to us by our \\nsuppliers, when obtainable, may not cover all damages and losses suffered by us and our customers arising from \\nintellectual property infringement claims. Furthermore, in connection with our divestitures, we have agreed, and may in \\nthe future agree, to provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities, including those associated with intellectual \\nproperty claims. Regardless of their merits, intellectual property claims are often time consuming and expensive to \\nlitigate or settle. To the extent such claims are successful, they could harm our business, including our product and \\nservice offerings, financial condition, and operating results. \\nExpectations relating to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations could expose us to \\npotential liabilities, increased costs, and reputational harm. \\nWe are subject to laws, regulations, and other measures that govern a wide range of topics, including those \\nrelated to matters beyond our core products and services.

Further, if we are \\nunable or fail to collect taxes on behalf of customers, employees and partners as the withholding agent, we could \\nbecome liable for taxes that are levied against third parties. \\nWe are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities. As a result, we have \\nreceived, and may in the future receive, assessments in multiple jurisdictions, on various tax-related assertions, such \\nas transfer-pricing adjustments or permanent-establishment claims. Any adverse outcome of such a review or audit \\ncould harm our financial condition and operating results, require adverse changes to our business practices, or subject \\nus to additional litigation and regulatory inquiries. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income \\ntaxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment and often involves uncertainty. Although we believe our \\nestimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements \\nand may affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made. \\nFurthermore, due to shifting economic and political conditions, tax policies, laws, or rates in various jurisdictions \\nmay be subject to significant changes in ways that could harm our financial condition and operating results. Various \\njurisdictions around the world have enacted or are considering revenue-based taxes such as digital services taxes and \\nother targeted taxes, which could lead to inconsistent and potentially overlapping international tax regimes. The \\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development continues to advance proposals for modernizing \\ninternational tax rules. \\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Stock \\nWe cannot guarantee that any share repurchase program will be fully consummated or will enhance long-\\nterm stockholder value, and share repurchases could increase the volatility of our stock prices and could \\ndiminish our cash reserves. \\nWe engage in share repurchases of our Class A and Class C stock from time to time in accordance with \\nauthorizations from the Board of Directors of Alphabet. Our repurchase program does not have an expiration date and \\ndoes not obligate Alphabet to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares. \\nFurther, our share repurchases could affect our share trading prices, increase their volatility, reduce our cash reserves \\nand may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading prices of our stock. \\nThe concentration of our stock ownership limits our stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters. \\nOur Class B stock has 10 votes per share, our Class A stock has one vote per share, and our Class C stock has \\nno voting rights. As of December 31, 2022, Larry Page and Sergey Brin beneficially owned approximately 85.8% of our \\noutstanding Class B stock, which represented approximately 51.2% of the voting power of our outstanding common \\nstock. Through their stock ownership, Larry and Sergey have significant influence over all matters requiring \\nstockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or \\nother sale of our company or our assets, for the foreseeable future. In addition, because our Class C stock carries no \\nvoting rights (except as required by applicable law), the issuance of the Class C stock, including in future stock-based \\nacquisition transactions and to fund employee equity incentive programs, could continue Larry and Sergey’s current \\nrelative voting power and their ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters \\nsubmitted to a vote of our stockholders. The share repurchases made pursuant to our repurchase program may also \\naffect Larry and Sergey’s relative voting power. This concentrated control limits or severely restricts other stockholders’ \\nability to influence corporate matters and we may take actions that some of our stockholders do not view as beneficial, \\nwhich could reduce the market price of our Class A stock and our Class C stock. \\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that \\nstockholders may consider favorable. \\nProvisions in Alphabet’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a \\nchange of control or changes in our management.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The extent to which our business will continue to be affected will depend on a \\nvariety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including the persistence of the pandemic, impacts on \\neconomic activity, and the possibility of recession or continued financial market instability. \\nOur operating results may fluctuate, which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our \\nresults to fall short of expectations. \\nOur operating results have fluctuated, and may in the future fluctuate, as a result of a number of factors, many \\noutside of our control, including the cyclicality and seasonality in our business and geopolitical events. As a result, \\ncomparing our operating results (including our expenses as a percentage of our revenues) on a period-to-period basis \\nmay not be meaningful, and our past results should not be relied on as an indication of our future performance. \\nConsequently, our operating results in future quarters may fall below expectations. \\nAcquisitions, joint ventures, investments, and divestitures could result in operating difficulties, dilution, \\nand other consequences that could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. \\nAcquisitions, joint ventures, investments, and divestitures are important elements of our overall corporate strategy \\nand use of capital, and these transactions could be material to our financial condition and operating results. We expect \\nto continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of such potential strategic transactions, which \\ncould create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures.

We report Google in two segments, \\nGoogle Services and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. For further \\ndetails on our segments , see Part I, Item 1 “Business” and Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \\nincluded in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nTrend s in Our Business and Financial Effect\\nThe following long-term trends have contributed to the results of our consolidated operations, and we anticipate \\nthat they will continue to affect our future results:\\n•Users\\'  behaviors and advertising continue to shift online  as the digital economy evolves .\\nThe continuing shift from an offline to online world has contributed to the growth of our business and our revenues \\nsince inception. We expect that this shift to an online world will continue to benefit our business and our revenues, \\nalthough at a slower pace than we have experienced historically, in particular after the outsized growth in our \\nadvertising revenues during the COVID-19 pandemic . In addition, w e face increasing competition for user engagement \\nand advertisers, which may affect our revenues.\\n•Users  continue to access our products and services using diverse devices and modalities, which \\nallows for new advertising formats that may benefit our revenues but advers ely affect our margins .   \\nOur users are accessing the Internet via diverse devices and modalities, such as smartphones, wearables, and \\nsmart home devices, and want to be able to be connected no matter where they are or what they are doing. We are \\nfocused on expanding our products and services to stay in front of these trends in order to maintain and grow our \\nbusiness.\\nWe benefit from advertising revenues generated from different channels, including mobile, and newer advertising \\nformats . The margins from these channels and newer products have generally been lower than those from traditional \\ndesktop search. Additionally, as the market for a particular device type or modality matures, our advertising revenues \\nmay be affected.  For example, growth in the global smartphone market has slowed due to various factors, including \\nincreased market saturation in developed countries, which can affect our mobile advertising revenues.\\nWe expect TAC paid to our distribution partners and Google Network partners to increase as our rev enues grow \\nand TAC as a percentage of our advertising revenues (\"TAC rate\") to be affected by changes in device mix; geographic \\nmix; partner mix; partner agreement terms; the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points; product \\nmix; the relative revenue growth rates of advertising revenues from different channels; and revenue share terms.\\nWe expect these trends to continue to affect our revenues and put pressure on our margins.\\n•As online advertising evolves, we continue to expand our  product offerings, which may affect our \\nmonetization .\\nAs interactions between users and advertisers change, and as online user behavior evolves, we continue to \\nexpand  our product offerings to serve these changing needs, which may affect our monetization . For example, \\nrevenues from ads on YouTube  and Google Play monetize  at a lower rate than our traditional  search ads . We also  may \\ndevelop new products incorporating AI innovations that could affect our monetization trends. Additionally, when \\ndeveloping new products and services we generally focus first on user experience before prioritizing monetization.\\n•As users in developing economies increasingly come online, our revenues from international markets \\ncontinue to increase, and may require continued investments. In addition, movements in foreign exchange \\nrates affect such revenues. \\nThe shift to online, as well as the advent of the multi-device world, has brought opportunities outside of the U.S., \\nincluding in emerging markets, such as India. We continue to invest  heavily  and develop localized versions of our \\nproducts and advertising programs relevant to our users in these markets.

We expect that our results will continue to be affected by our performance in these \\nmarkets, particularly as low-cost mobile devices become more available. This trend could affect our revenues as \\ndeveloping markets initially monetize at a lower rate than more mature markets.\\nInternational revenues represent a significant portion of our revenues and are subject to fluctuations in foreign \\ncurrency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. While we have a foreign exchange risk management program \\ndesigned to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations, this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues \\nand earnings.\\n•The revenues  that we derive from non-advertising products and services are increasing and may \\nadversely affect our margins.\\nNon-advertising revenues have grown over time, and we expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding \\nour products and services . The margins on these revenues vary significantly and are generally lower than the margins \\non our advertising revenues. In particular margin s on our hardware products adversely affect our consolidated margins \\ndue to pressures on pricing and higher cost of sales.\\n•As we continue  to serve our users and expand our businesses, we will invest heavily in operating and \\ncapital expenditures .\\nWe continue to make significant research and development investments in areas of strategic focus as we seek to \\ndevelop new, innovative offerings and improve our existing offerings  across our businesses . We also expect to \\ncontinue to invest in our technical infrastructure, including servers, network equipment, and data centers, to support \\nthe growth of our business and our long-term initiatives, in part icular in support of AI . In addition acquisitions and \\nstrategic investments contribute to the breadth and depth of our offerings, expand our expertise in engineering and \\nother functional areas, and build strong partnerships around strategic initiatives. For example, in September 2022 we \\nclosed the acquisition of Mandiant to help expand our offerings in dynamic cyber defense and response. \\n•We face continuing changes in regulatory conditions, laws, and public policies, which could affect our \\nbusiness pr actices and financial results.\\nChanges in social, political, economic, tax, and regulatory conditions or in laws and policies governing a wide \\nrange of topics and related legal matters have resulted in fines and caused us to change our business practices. As \\nthese global trends continue, our cost of doing business may increase, our ability to pursue certain business models or \\noffer certain products or services may be limited, and we may need to change our business practices. Examples \\ninclude the antitrust complaints filed by the U.S. Department of Justice and a number of state Attorneys Genera l; \\npending litigation in the U.S., EU, and around the world that could diminish or eliminate safe harbor protection for \\nwebsites and online platforms; and th e Digital Markets Act and Digital Services Act in Europe  and various legislative \\nproposals in the U.S. focused on large technology platforms.  For additional information se e Item 1A Risk Factors and \\nLegal Matters in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8.\\n•Our employees are critical to our success and we expect to continue investing in them.\\nOur employees are among our best assets and are critical for our continued success. We expect to continue \\nhiring talented employees around the globe and to provide competitive compensation programs. For additional \\ninformation see Culture and Workforce in Part I, Item 1 “Business.”\\nRevenues and Monetization Metrics\\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide \\nenterprise customers of all sizes with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration \\ntools; sales of other products and services, such as apps and in-app purchases, and hardware; and fees received for \\nsubscription-based products.

We believe the \\npresentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles \\n(GAAP) results helps improve the ability to understand our performance, because it excludes the effects of foreign \\ncurrency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results.\\nConstant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant \\nperiod over period. We define constant currency revenues as revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate \\nmovements (\"FX Effect\") as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level. We use constant \\ncurrency revenues to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a year-on-year basis.

These investments are accounted for under the measurement alternative method (\"the \\nmeasurement alternative\") and are measured at cost, less impairment, subject to upward and downward adjustments \\nresulting from observable price changes for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. These adjustments \\nrequire quantitative assessments of the fair value of our securities, which may require the use of unobservable inputs. \\nPricing adjustments are determined by using various valuation methodologies and involve the use of estimates using \\nthe best information available, which may include cash flow projections or other available market data.\\nNon-marketable equity securities are also evaluated for impairment, based on qualitative factors including the \\ncompanies\\' financial and liquidity position and access to capital resources, among others. When indicators of \\nimpairment exist, we prepare quantitative measurements of the fair value of our equity investments using a market \\napproach or an income approach, which requires judgment and the use of unobservable inputs, including discount \\nrates, investee revenues and costs, and comparable market data of private and public companies, among others. \\nWhen the quantitative remeasurements of fair value indicate an impairment exists, we write down the investment to its \\ncurrent fair value.\\nWe also have compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized returns from certain investments, i.e. \\nperformance fees. We record compensation expense based on the estimated payouts on an ongoing basis , which may \\nresult in expense recognized before investment returns are realized and compensation is paid and may require the use \\nof unobservable inputs.\\nProperty and Equipment\\nWe assess the reasonableness of the useful lives of our property and equipment periodically as well as when \\nother changes occur, such as when there are changes to ongoing business operations, changes in the planned use \\nand utilization of assets, or technological advancements, that could indicate a change in the period over which we \\nexpect to benefit from the assets.

Significant judgment is required in evaluating \\nour uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes.\\nRecording an uncertain tax position involves various qualitative considerations, including evaluation of \\ncomparable and resolved tax exposures, applicability of tax laws, and likelihood of settlement. We evaluate uncertain \\ntax positions periodically, considering changes in facts and circumstances, such as new regulations or recent judicial \\nopinions, as well as the status of audit activities by taxing authorities. Although we believe we have adequately \\nreserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not \\nbe different. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such \\ndifferences will affect the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination \\nis made.\\nThe provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are \\nconsidered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties. In addition, we are subject to the continuous \\nexamination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Services (IRS) and other tax authorities which may \\nassert assessments against us. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these \\nexaminations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.\\nLoss Contingencies\\nWe ar e regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and \\nconsent orders involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor \\nand employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or \\npublishers using our platforms, personal injury consumer protection, and other matters.  Certain of these matters \\ninclude speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe \\nthat it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a \\nloss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in Note 10 of \\nthe Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \\nWe evaluate, on a regular basis, developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that \\nhas been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make \\nadjustments and changes to our disclosures as appropriate.

Principal currencies hedged included the Australian dollar, British pound, Canadian dollar, Euro, and \\nJapanese yen. For the purpose of analyzing foreign currency exchange risk, we considered the historical trends in \\nforeign currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange \\nrates of 10% could be experienced.\\nWe use foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on assets and liabilities \\ndenominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary. These forward and option contracts \\nreduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and \\nliabilities.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\nNature of Operations\\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August \\n2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (\"Alphabet\") became \\nthe successor issuer to Google.\\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide \\nenterprise customers with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration tools; sales \\nof other products and services, such as apps and in-app purchases, and hardware; and fees received for subscription-\\nbased produ cts.\\nBasis of Consolidation\\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated \\nunder the variable interest and voting models.  Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\\nUse of Estimates\\nPreparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and \\nassumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. \\nActual results could differ materially from these estimates due to uncertainties . On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our \\nestimates, including those related to the allowance for credit losses; fair values of financial instruments, intangible \\nassets, and goodwill; inventory; useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment; income taxes; and \\ncontingent liabilities, among others.  We base our estimates on assumptions, both historical and forward looking, that \\nare believed to be reasonable, and the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values \\nof assets and liabilities.\\nIn January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and \\nadjusted the estimated useful life of our servers from four years  to six years  and the estimated useful life of certain \\nnetwork equipment from five years  to six years . This change in accounting estimate is effective beginning in fiscal year \\n2023. \\nStock Split Effected in the Form of a Stock Dividend (“Stock Split”)\\nOn February 1, 2022, the company announced that the Board of Directors had approved and declared a 20-for-\\none stock split in the form of a one-time special stock dividend on each share of the company’s Class A, Class B, and \\nClass C stock. The Stock Split had a record date of July 1, 2022 and an effective date of July 15, 2022. The par value \\nper share of our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock remains unchanged at $0.001  per share after the Stock Split.

If we have an intent to sell, or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell a debt \\nsecurity in an unrealized loss position before recovery of its amortized cost basis, we will write down the security to its \\nfair value and record the corresponding charge as a component of other income (expense), net. \\nFor non-marketable equity securities, including equity method investments, we consider whether impairment \\nindicators exist by evaluating the companies' financial and liquidity position and access to capital resources, among \\nother indicators. If the assessment indicates that the investment is impaired, we write down the investment to its fair \\nvalue by recording the corresponding charge as a component of other income (expense), net.

Cost is \\ncomputed using the first-in, first-out method.\\nVariable Interest Entities\\nWe determine at the inception of each arrangement whether an entity in which we have made an investment or in \\nwhich we have other variable interests is considered a variable interest entity (VIE). We consolidate VIEs when we are \\nthe primary beneficiary. We are the primary beneficiary of a VIE when we have the power to direct activities that most \\nsignificantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and have the obligation to absorb the majority of their losses \\nor benefits. If we are not the primary beneficiary in a VIE, we account for the investment or other variable interests in a \\nVIE in accordance with applicable GAAP.\\nPeriodically, we assess whether any changes in our interest or relationship with the entity affect our determination \\nof whether the entity is a VIE and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary. \\nProperty and Equipment\\nProperty and equipment includes the following categories: land and buildings, information technology assets, \\nconstruction in progress, leasehold improvements, and furniture and fixtures. Land and buildings include land, offices, \\ndata centers, and related building improvements. Information technology assets include servers and network \\nequipment. Construction in progress is the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet \\nbeen placed in service. \\nWe account for property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation. We compute depreciation using \\nthe straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which we regularly evaluate. Land is not \\ndepreciated. We depreciate buildings over periods of seven  to 25 years . We depreciate information technology assets \\ngenerally over periods of four to five years  (generally, four years  for servers and five years  for network equipment) . We \\ndepreciate leasehold improvements over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the \\nassets. Depreciation for buildings, information technology assets, leasehold improvements, and furniture and fixtures \\ncommences once they are ready for our intended us e.\\nLeases\\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Our lease agreements generally contain lease and non-\\nlease components. Payments under our lease arrangements are primarily fixed. Non-lease components primarily \\ninclude payments for maintenance and utilities. We combine fixed payments for non-lease components with lease \\npayments and account for them together as a single lease component which increases the amount of our lease assets \\nand liabilities.\\nCertain lease agreements contain variable payments, which are expensed as incurred and not included in the \\nlease assets and liabilities. These amounts include payments affected by the Consumer Price Index, payments \\ncontingent on wind or solar production for power purchase arrangements, and payments for maintenance and utilities.\\nLease assets and liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease \\ncommencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present value of the future lease payments is our \\nincremental borrowing rate, because the interest rate implicit in our leases is not readily determinable. Our incremental \\nborrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments, \\nand in economic environments where the leased asset is located. Our lease terms include periods under options to \\nextend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. We generally use the \\nbase, non-cancelable, lease term when determining the lease assets and liabilities. Lease assets also include any \\nprepaid lease payments and lease incentives.\\nOperating lease assets and liabilities are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The current portion of our \\noperating lease liabilities is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and the long-term portion is \\nincluded in operating lease liabilities. Finance lease assets are included in property and equipment, net. Finance lease \\nliabilities are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities or long-term debt.\\nOperating lease expense (excluding variable lease costs) is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease \\nterm.\\nLong-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets\\nWe review property and equipment and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, for impairment when events or \\nchanges in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable.

The fair value option was elected for these securities to align with the \\nunrealized gains and losses from related derivative contracts.\\nThe following table s summarize our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities measured at fair value on \\na recurring basis  (in millions):\\nAs of December 31, 2021\\nFair Value \\nHierarchyAdjusted \\nCostGross \\nUnrealized \\nGainsGross \\nUnrealized \\nLosses Fair ValueCash and \\nCash \\nEquivalentsMarketable \\nSecurities\\nFair value changes \\nrecorded in other \\ncomprehensive income\\nTime deposits(1)Level 2 $ 5,133 $ 0 $ 0 $ 5,133 $ 5,133 $ 0 \\nGovernment bonds Level 2 53,288  258  (238)  53,308  5  53,303 \\nCorporate debt securities Level 2 35,605  194  (223)  35,576  12  35,564 \\nMortgage-backed and \\nasset-backed securities Level 2 18,829  96  (112)  18,813  0  18,813 \\nTotal investments with \\nfair value change \\nreflected in Other \\nComprehensive \\nIncome(2)$ 112,855 $ 548 $ (573) $ 112,830 $ 5,150 $ 107,680 \\nFair value adjustments \\nrecorded in net income\\nMoney market funds Level 1 $ 7,499 $ 7,499 $ 0 \\nCurrent marketable \\nequity securities(3)Level 1\\n 5,998  0  5,998 \\nMutual funds Level 2  351  0  351 \\nGovernment bonds Level 2  1,165  0  1,165 \\nCorporate debt securities Level 2  2,503  0  2,503 \\nMortgage-backed and \\nasset-backed securitiesLevel 2\\n 1,007  0  1,007 \\nTotal investments with \\nfair value change \\nrecorded in Net \\nIncome $ 18,523 $ 7,499 $ 11,024 \\nCash  0  8,296  0 \\nTotal $ 112,855 $ 548 $ (573) $ 131,353 $ 20,945 $ 118,704 \\n(1)The majority of our time deposits are domestic deposits. \\n(2)Represents gross unrealized gains and losses for debt securities recorded to AOCI.\\n(3)The long-term portion of marketable equity securities (subject to long-term lock-up restrictions) of  $1.4 billion  as of \\nDecember 31, 2021  is included within other non-current assets.Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\n60', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Our share of gains and losses, including impairments, are included as a \\ncomponent of other income (expense), net, in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 7  for further details \\non other income (expense), net.  \\nDerivative Financial Instruments\\nWe use derivative instruments  to manage risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary risk \\nmanaged is foreign exchange risk. We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the risk that our cash flows, earnings, \\nand investment in foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We \\nalso enter into derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to other risks and enhance investment returns.\\nWe recognize derivative instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classify the derivatives \\nprimarily within  Level 2  in the fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts (an option strategy comprised of a \\ncombination of purchased and written options) at net fai r values  and present all other derivatives at gross fair values. \\nThe accounting treatment for derivatives is based on the intended use and hedge designation.\\nCash Flow Hedges\\nWe designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge \\ncertain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These contracts have \\nmaturities of 24 months  or less.\\nCash flow hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and \\nsubsequently reclassified to revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude forward points and \\ntime value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the life of the \\nhedging instrument in revenues. The difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and the \\namount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI.\\nAs of December 31, 2022 , the net accumulated gain on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect \\nwas $171 million , which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into revenues within the next 12 months.\\nFair Value Hedges\\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our \\nmarketable securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fair value hedge amounts included in the \\nassessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net, along with the offsetting gains and \\nlosses of the related hedged items. We exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and \\nrecognize changes in the excluded component in other income (expense), net.\\nNet Investment Hedges\\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks \\nrelated to our investment in foreign subsidiaries. Net investment hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge \\neffectiveness are recognized in AOCI along with the foreign currency translation adjustment. We exclude forward \\npoints from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in other income \\n(expense), net.\\nOther Derivatives\\nWe enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to \\nhedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the \\nfunctional currency of a subsidiary.  Gains and losses on these derivatives that are not designated as accounting \\nhedges are primarily recorded in other income (expense), net along with the foreign currency gains and losses on \\nmonetary assets and liabilities.\\nWe also use derivatives not designated as hedging instruments to manage risks relating to interest rates, \\ncommodity prices, credit exposures, and to enhance investment returns. From time to time, we enter into derivatives to \\nhedge the market price risk on certain of our marketable equity securities. Gains and losses arising from other \\nderivatives are primarily reflected within the “other” component of other income (expense), net. See Note 7  for further \\ndetails.

We have agreed \\nto hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of \\nintellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these agreements limit the \\ntime within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered into \\nindemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations \\nto our agents.\\nIt is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification \\nagreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally,  the \\npayment s we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations, \\ncash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the future, future \\npayments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows \\nin a particular period. \\nAs of December 31, 2022 , we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably \\npossible. \\nLegal Matters\\nWe record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be \\nreasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be \\nestimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could affect \\nthe amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses \\ndisclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate.\\nCertain outstanding matters include speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts. Significant \\njudgment is required to determine both the likelihood of there being a loss and the estimated amount of a loss related \\nto such matters, and we may be unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of losses. The outcomes of \\noutstanding legal matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and could, either \\nindividually or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect.\\nWe expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.\\nAntitrust Investigations\\nOn November 30, 2010, the EC's Directorate General for Competition opened an investigation into various \\nantitrust-related complaints against us. \\nOn June 27, 2017, the EC announced its decision that certain actions taken by Google regarding its display and \\nranking of shopping search results and ads infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a €2.4 \\nbillion  ($2.7 billion  as of June 27, 2017 ) fine. On September 11, 2017, we appealed the EC decision to the General \\nCourt, and on September 27, 2017, we implemented product changes to bring shopping ads into compliance with the \\nEC's decision. We recognized a charge of $2.7 billion  for the fine in the second quarter of 2017.

The DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit on October 20, 2020 alleging that \\nGoogle violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to Search and Search advertising . Further, in June  2022, the \\nAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and the United Kingdom's Competition and \\nMarkets Authority (CMA) each opened an investigation into Search distribution practices.\\n•On December 16, 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District \\nCourt for the Eastern District of Texas, alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as state \\ndeceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology. Additionally, on January 24, 2023, the DOJ, along \\nwith a number of state Attorneys General, filed an antitrust complaint alleging that Google’s digital advertising \\ntechnology products violate U.S. antitrust laws. The EC, the CMA, and the ACCC each opened a formal \\ninvestigation into Google's advertising technology business practices on June 22, 2021, May 25, 2022, and \\nJune 29, 2022, respectively.\\n•On July 7, 2021, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District Court for \\nthe Northern District of California, alleging that Google’s operation of Android and Google Play violated U.S. \\nantitrust laws and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. In May 2022, the EC and the CMA each \\nopened investigations into Google Play’s business practices.

As a result, we may have to change \\nour business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for \\nus and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has increasingly \\nbecome an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC action can \\nresult in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important market, a \\nprohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing many important \\nproducts into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.\\nFurthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against \\ncertain intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, \\nand may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims.

All \\nprior period references made to share or per share amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements \\nand applicable disclosures have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effects of the Stock Split. See Note 1 for \\nfurther details.  \\nShare  Repurchases\\nIn April 2022, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $70.0 billion  of its \\nClass A and Class C shares. As of December 31, 2022 , $28.1 billion  remains available for Class A and Class C share \\nrepurchases. \\nThe following table presents Class A and Class C shares repurchased and subsequently retired  (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31, 2021 Year Ended December 31, 2022\\nShares Amount Shares Amount\\nClass A share repurchases 24$ 3,399 61$ 6,719 \\nClass C share repurchases 383  46,875 469  52,577 \\nTotal share repurchases 407 $ 50,274 530 $ 59,296 \\nClass A and Class C shares are repurchased in a manner deemed in the best interest of the company and its \\nstockholders, taking into account the economic cost and prevailing market conditions, including the relative trading \\nprices and volumes of the Class A and Class C shares.

The repurchase program does not have an \\nexpiration date.\\nNote 12.    Net Income Per Share  \\nWe compute net income per share of Class A, Class B, and Class C stock using the two-class method. Basic net \\nincome per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net \\nincome per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares and the effect of potentially dilutive \\nsecurities outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive securities consist of restricted stock units and other \\ncontingently issuable shares.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\\nOur management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer,  evaluated the \\neffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, as of the \\nend of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nBased on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of December 31, \\n2022 , our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to \\nprovide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the \\nExchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules \\nand forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief \\nexecutive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter  \\nended December 31, 2022  that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal \\ncontrol over financial reporting. \\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial \\nreporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our management conducted an evaluation of the \\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control—Integrated \\nFramework  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). \\nBased on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of \\nDecember 31, 2022 . Management reviewed the results of its assessment with our Audit and Compliance Committee. \\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022  has been audited by Ernst & \\nYoung LLP , an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included in Item 8 of this \\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures\\nIn designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls \\nand procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the \\ndesired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there \\nare resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible \\ncontrols and procedures relative to their costs.\\nITEM 9B.
